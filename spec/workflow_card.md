# Workflow card

The **Workflow card** is the single persistent action card at the
top of every operator session page. It carries state-aware
explanatory copy, **two rows of action buttons** (a prep row and a
run row, both in the left column), and a right-column status
aside. The card is the canonical entry-point for every
lifecycle-advancing action on a session — from preparing the
assignment pairs through to sending reminders.

The H2 the operator reads is "Workflow". The template / CSS
class names use the `next_action` prefix (the card's earlier
name); the prefix is kept to avoid touching every consumer.

## Where it renders

The card renders on every session-scoped operator page that's
useful while the session is mid-lifecycle:

- **Session Home** (`/operator/sessions/{id}`) — full-width, just
  below the chrome.
- **Operations-row pages** — full-width, just below the chrome,
  on Assignments / Validate / Previews / Invitations / Responses.

The card does not render on Setup-row pages (Reviewers /
Reviewees / Relationships / Instruments) or on the per-session
edit / extract / outbox sub-pages.

Each host page sets `next_action_return_to` to its Operations-row
slug so that every POST the card emits — `/workflow/prepare`,
`/workflow/activate`, `/revert`, `/invitations/generate`,
`/invitations/send-all`, `/invitations/remind-incomplete` — 303s
back to the page that rendered the card. Allowed slugs:

- `home` (Session Home; resolved server-side to
  `/operator/sessions/{id}`)
- `reviewers` / `reviewees` / `assignments` / `instruments` (Setup
  + Assignments)
- `validate` / `previews` / `invitations` / `responses` (the
  remaining Operations-row pages)

The allowlist is `_REVERT_RETURN_TO` in
`app/web/routes_operator/_shared.py`.

## Inputs the card reads

Every page route builds the card's context with one call to
`views.build_workflow_card_context(db, review_session, *,
return_to, validated_just_ran=False, super_failure=None,
prepare_confirm=None, user=None, correlation_id=None)` and merges
the returned dict into its template context via `**workflow_ctx`.
The builder lives in `app/web/views/_workflow_card.py`. It
returns:

- `is_draft` / `is_validated` / `is_ready` — lifecycle booleans
  from `lifecycle.is_*`.
- `is_setup_empty` — `True` iff the session is in draft AND any of:
  reviewer count is 0, reviewee count is 0, or at least one
  instrument has no assignment rule pinned (checked via
  `instruments.has_unpinned`, which also returns `True` when the
  session has zero instruments).
- `is_pre_generate` — retained for external consumers; the card's
  state cascade no longer branches on it.
- `invitations_generated` — `True` iff at least one `Invitation`
  row exists for the session.
- `invitations_sent` — `True` iff at least one `Invitation` row
  has a non-NULL `sent_at`.
- `validation_summary` — `dict | None`. Populated when
  `validated_just_ran=True` OR the session is already
  `validated`. Keys: `error_count` / `warning_count` /
  `info_count` (from the readiness report); `can_activate`
  (`report.can_activate AND is_validated(session)`);
  `needs_acknowledge` (`report.has_non_blocking_findings`).
- `validation_issues_by_severity` — `dict[str, list]` with
  `errors` / `warnings` / `info` lists from
  `lifecycle.build_readiness_report`.
- `setup_checklist` — three-boolean dict (`reviewers_ok`,
  `reviewees_ok`, `instruments_pinned_ok`) driving the State 1
  right-column checklist.
- `super_failure` — `dict | None` decoded from the redirect's
  `?super_status=failed&super_button=...&super_step=...&super_error=...`
  query-param set via `views.parse_super_failure`. Slots:
  `button` (`"prepare"` / `"activate"`), `step`, `error`. Drives
  the workflow-failure signal line.
- `prepare_confirm` — `dict | None`. Populated
  (`responses_deleted` / `deleted_pairs` keys) when the builder
  is called with `prepare_confirm="responses"` AND a dry-run
  reconcile shows a Prepare run would delete one or more
  responses. Drives the saved-response confirmation banner in
  the card body.
- `scheduled_activation_caption` — `dict | None` shaped
  `{"tone": ..., "text": ...}`, built by
  `build_scheduled_activation_caption`. Drives the scheduled-
  activation signal line. `None` when there's nothing to surface.
- `auto_send_invites_caption` — `dict | None` of the same shape,
  built by `build_auto_send_invites_caption`. Drives the auto-
  send invites signal line.
- `auto_send_reminders_caption` — `dict | None` of the same shape,
  built by `build_auto_send_reminders_caption`. Drives the auto-
  send reminders signal line.
- `manual_activate_cancellation` — `dict | None`. Confirmation-
  modal payload for the Activate button when a manual Activate
  click would cancel pending auto-sends, built by
  `build_manual_activate_cancellation`. Shape:
  `{"text": "N scheduled auto-send(s) will be cancelled…",
  "count": int, "pending_fires": list[str]}`. `None` when nothing
  would be cancelled. The modal lives on the button itself, not
  the right column — see §"Manual-activate cancellation modal".
- `next_action_return_to` — the `return_to` slug, passed
  through.

When `validated_just_ran=True` (the page was reached with
`?validated=1`) AND the readiness report is clean AND the session
is still in draft, the builder also calls
`lifecycle.mark_validated` to flip `draft → validated` before
populating the rest of the context. `user` and `correlation_id`
must be passed in for that path to fire.

A companion helper `views.parse_super_failure(super_status,
super_step, super_error, super_button)` decodes the workflow
buttons' redirect failure params into the `super_failure` dict
(or `None`). The `super_button` slot identifies which button
failed (`"prepare"` or `"activate"`) so the failure line's copy
varies accordingly; when absent on a legacy URL it falls back
from the step name (`generate` / `validate` → `"prepare"`;
`activate` → `"activate"`; `precondition` → `"prepare"`).

## State machine

The card has ten states. The body and right column are chosen by
this cascade in `next_action_card.html`:

```
if is_setup_empty:                              → State 1
elif is_draft and validation_summary:           → State 3
elif is_draft:                                  → State 2
elif is_validated:
    if not validation_summary.can_activate:     → State 4Err
    elif needs_acknowledge:                     → State 4W
    elif invitations.none:                      → State 4
    elif invitations.generated_not_sent:        → State 5
    else (invitations.sent):                    → State 6
elif is_ready:
    if invitations.none:                        → State 7
    elif invitations.generated_not_sent:        → State 8
    else (invitations.sent):                    → State 9
```

State 4Err is defensive — `mark_validated` only flips
`draft → validated` on a clean report, so re-running Validate in
the `validated` lifecycle and finding errors is rare (it requires
a setup edit that the lifecycle's `invalidate_if_validated` hook
missed).

### Per-state body copy

| State | Trigger | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | `is_setup_empty` | "Session not fully set up. Make sure that reviewers, reviewees, relationships (optional), and instruments have been set up before continuing." |
| **2** | `is_draft`, no `validation_summary` | "Run **Prepare session** to generate the assignment pairs and validate that the setup is ready for prime time. Nothing goes live until you activate." |
| **3** | `is_draft` + `validation_summary` | "**Validation didn't pass.** Resolve the errors and re-run **Prepare session**." |
| **4** | `is_validated` + `can_activate` + no warnings + no invitations | "Setup is prepared and the reviewer surface is previewable. Create invites and send them ahead of Activation, or Activate to receive responses." |
| **4W** | `is_validated` + `can_activate` + `needs_acknowledge` | Same as 4 plus help-line: "{N} warning(s) — review on Validate before activating." |
| **4Err** | `is_validated`, not `can_activate` (defensive) | "Validation shows that there are error(s). Resolve them and re-run **Prepare session** before activating." |
| **5** | `is_validated`, invites generated, none sent | "Invitations are ready to send. Send them ahead of Activation to notify reviewers, or Activate now and send afterwards." |
| **6** | `is_validated`, invites sent | "Reviewers have been notified that the review will open. Activate the session when you're ready to receive responses." |
| **7** | `is_ready`, no Invitation rows yet | "Session is open for responses. Create invites and send them so reviewers know they can start." |
| **8** | `is_ready`, invites generated, none sent | "Session is open. Send the prepared invitations so reviewers know they can start." |
| **9** | `is_ready`, invites sent | "Session is open. Send reminders if reviewers fall behind." |

## Layout

Two-column inner grid: the body copy and **two rows of action
buttons** in the left column, the per-state status aside in the
right column:

```

```

`grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 11fr) minmax(0, 9fr)` — the
left column takes ~55% and the right column ~45% (the left
column carries up to four buttons per row, so it gets slightly
more room than 50/50). The left column carries a 1px right
border that reads as a vertical divider; below ~720 px viewport
width the columns collapse to a single stacked column and the
divider becomes a horizontal rule above the right-column
content.

Each button row is a `.next-action-buttons.next-action-buttons-row`
flex container whose children stretch (`flex: 1 1 0`) so the
row's buttons distribute evenly across the left column's width.

**Stable card height.** The `.next-action-body` div flex-grows
(`flex: 1 1 auto`) and carries `min-height: 3.5em` — enough for
~2 rows of body text. The two action button rows sink to the
bottom of the left column regardless of body length, and the
card doesn't grow / shrink as the state-specific copy goes from
one line to two. Multi-paragraph states (e.g. State 3's two-line
body) or the prepare-confirm banner still expand the body beyond
the min — the rule sets a floor, not a ceiling.

CSS lives in `app/web/templates/base.html` next to the
`.card.next-action` rules.

## Workflow stepper — two rows of buttons

The left column hosts two rows of action buttons. **Row 1 (prep
phase)** carries the actions an operator runs before reviewers
see anything; **Row 2 (run phase)** carries the actions during
and after the review window. Close session renders as an inert
**placeholder** in Row 2 — its behaviour ships alongside the
`expired` lifecycle status work, but the slot stays in the grid
so the eventual primary doesn't shift the layout.

```
Row 1 (prep): Revert to draft · Prepare session · Create invites
Row 2 (run):  Send invites · Activate session · Send reminders · Close session
```

Each slot is either **live** (Primary or Secondary, clickable)
or **inert** (`<button disabled aria-disabled="true">`, rendered
in the Secondary style for visual consistency). Revert is
rendered in Secondary style whenever it's live — the stepper
never promotes it to Primary.

`Pri` = Primary live, `Sec` = Secondary live, `—` = inert.

**Row 1 (prep) — Revert · Prepare · Create invites**

| Button | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4W | 4Err | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revert to draft | — | — | — | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec |
| Prepare session | — | **Pri** | **Pri** | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec | — | — | — |
| Create invites | — | — | — | **Pri** | **Pri** | — | Sec | Sec | **Pri** | Sec | Sec |

**Row 2 (run) — Send invites · Activate · Send reminders · Close session**

| Button | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4W | 4Err | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Send invites | — | — | — | — | — | — | **Pri** | Sec | — | **Pri** | Sec |
| Activate session | — | — | — | **Pri** | **Pri** (→ warn detour) | — | **Pri** | **Pri** | — | — | — |
| Send reminders | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | **Pri** |
| Close session | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

`Generate assignments` and `Validate setup` don't render as their
own stepper slots — they live inside **Prepare session**, which
runs Generate + Validate in sequence (see below).

### Prepare session

The Prepare session button POSTs to
`/operator/sessions/{id}/workflow/prepare` in `_workflow.py`,
which runs two lifecycle steps in sequence:

1. **Generate.** `assignments.replace_assignments(...)` —
   materialises one `Assignment` row per `(reviewer, reviewee,
   instrument)` triple eligible under each instrument's pinned
   rule. It **reconciles** the existing rows (see
   `spec/reconciling_regeneration.md`) — inserting newly eligible
   pairs, deleting pairs the rule no longer produces along with
   their responses, and leaving matched pairs and their responses
   untouched. The saved-response confirmation detour below gates
   this step when it would delete responses.
2. **Validate.** `validation.validate_session_setup(...)` →
   `lifecycle.build_readiness_report(...)`. When the report is
   clean and the session is still `draft`,
   `lifecycle.mark_validated(...)` flips `draft → validated`.
   When the report has errors, the chain stops here — assignment
   pairs survive, the session stays in `draft`, and the right-
   column issue list surfaces the diagnostic.

Pre-flight: Prepare runs only while the session is editable
(`draft` / `validated`). A `ready` session must be reverted first.

#### Saved-response confirmation detour

A session reverted from `ready` back to `draft` keeps its
responses (`revert_session_to_draft` preserves them). The
Generate step's reconcile deletes responses for any pair the rule
no longer produces, so re-preparing such a session could destroy
recorded data without warning.

The detour is **impact-driven**: it fires only when a run would
actually delete a response, not whenever responses merely exist.
When the session has responses and the POST carried no
`acknowledge_response_loss` field, the route dry-runs the
reconcile via `assignments.reconcile_impact(...)`. If that
impact's `responses_deleted` is zero, the run proceeds straight
through — no confirmation. If it is non-zero, the route 303s
back to the host page with `?prepare_confirm=responses`.

The workflow card decodes that param (via the `prepare_confirm`
builder kwarg, which re-runs `reconcile_impact` to populate the
`responses_deleted` / `deleted_pairs` counts) and renders a
confirmation banner in the card body:

- **Regenerate & prepare** posts back to `/workflow/prepare`
  with `acknowledge_response_loss=true`, which skips the detour
  so the run proceeds: the reconcile deletes the responses on
  the orphaned pairs, keeps the rest, and Validate follows.
- **Cancel** is a plain link back to the host page — nothing
  runs.

Like the warnings detour on Activate, the confirmation detour
writes no `workflow_run_failed` event — the run is paused at the
operator-choice step, not failed.

### Activate session

The Activate session button POSTs to
`/operator/sessions/{id}/workflow/activate`. Pre-flight requires
`validated` (Prepare must have run first) and refuses `ready`
(already activated).

The route recomputes the readiness report so a setup edit
between Prepare and Activate is caught before the live flip.
When the report has non-blocking findings, the route 303s to
the **warnings detour** at `/validate?activate=1`; the operator
acknowledges warnings inline and the Validate page's banner
re-POSTs to `/workflow/activate` with
`acknowledge_warnings=true`. When the report has errors (a
regression vs the Prepare report), Activate raises and the route
303s back with `super_status=failed`.

On clean activation, `lifecycle.activate_session(...)` flips
`validated → ready`, opens every instrument
(`accepting_responses = True`), and emits `session.activated`.

If Activate raises after `mark_validated`'s promotion (defensive
— `activate_session` itself is the only mutator), the except
branch calls `lifecycle.invalidate_session(...)` to roll the
session back to `draft`.

#### Warnings detour

When the Activate route's recomputed readiness report has
non-blocking findings, the route does NOT fire `activate_session`
directly. Instead it 303s to
`/operator/sessions/{id}/validate?activate=1&return_to=...`. The
Validate page renders a yellow `.banner.banner-warning` with the
warnings inline + an "Acknowledge and activate" submit; the
operator clicks Acknowledge, and a follow-up `/workflow/activate`
POST fires from that banner with `acknowledge_warnings=true`.

In State 4W the workflow card renders the Activate session
button as an `<a>` to the same warnings-detour URL so operators
reach the acknowledgement step without going through the Activate
POST in the first place.

#### Failure handling

Both routes wrap their step chain in a try/except that catches
`lifecycle.LifecycleError`, `ValueError`, and the route's
internal `_StepFailed` sentinel. The redirect URL carries
`super_status=failed&super_button=<prepare|activate>&super_step=<step>&super_error=<msg>`
so the workflow-failure signal line adapts.

**Prepare failures:**

- **Generate raises.** No rollback. Redirect carries
  `super_button=prepare&super_step=generate&super_error=<msg>`.
  Card lands in State 2 (draft, no summary) on next render.
- **Validate finds errors.** No rollback. The fresh assignments
  stay; the next render computes `validation_summary` with
  errors populated and the card lands in State 3. Redirect
  carries `super_button=prepare&super_step=validate`. The audit
  event records the failure for observability.

**Activate failures:**

- **Activate raises.** The except branch calls
  `lifecycle.invalidate_session(reason="workflow_run_rollback")`
  if the session was promoted to `validated`, which emits a
  `session.invalidated` audit event (the predicate
  `needs_regeneration_after_revert` then resolves the card to a
  draft state on the next render). Redirect carries
  `super_button=activate&super_step=activate`.

Each route emits two audit events bracketing the run:

- `session.workflow_run_started` — once per click, with
  `context.button` carrying `"prepare_session"` or
  `"activate_session"`.
- `session.workflow_run_failed` — emitted in the except branch
  with `context.button`, `context.step`, and
  `context.error_message`. Successful runs are documented by the
  per-step events (`assignments.generated` + `session.validated`
  for Prepare; `session.activated` for Activate) — no separate
  "succeeded" envelope.

The warnings detour and the saved-response confirmation detour
both write no `workflow_run_failed` event — the run is paused at
the operator-choice step, not failed.

Pre-flight gates:

- **Prepare** — session not editable (already `ready`) → 303
  with `super_button=prepare&super_step=precondition`.
- **Activate** — session already `ready` → 303 with
  `super_button=activate&super_step=precondition&super_error=Session+is+already+activated.`
- **Activate** — session not yet `validated` → 303 with
  `super_button=activate&super_step=precondition&super_error=Run+Prepare+session+before+activating.`
- `is_setup_empty` is True → no defensive gate at the route
  layer; the workflow card renders the Prepare button as inert
  in State 1 so the form can't post.

### Other stepper buttons

- **Create invites** posts to
  `/operator/sessions/{id}/invitations/generate` via
  `next-action-generate-invites-form`. Calls
  `invitations.generate_invitations`, which idempotently creates
  one `Invitation` row per assigned active reviewer (skipping
  reviewers with no `include=True` assignment and reviewers
  already invited).
- **Send invites** posts to
  `/operator/sessions/{id}/invitations/send-all` via
  `next-action-send-invites-form`. Iterates every pending
  invitation and dispatches via `invitations.send_invitation`.
- **Send reminders** posts to
  `/operator/sessions/{id}/invitations/remind-incomplete` via
  `next-action-send-reminders-form`. Calls
  `invitations.send_reminders_to_incomplete` for reviewers whose
  assignments aren't complete.

All three invitation forms emit on every ready state (7 / 8 / 9)
so the Secondary "re-run an earlier stage" buttons stay wired;
only the corresponding Primary slot's live state changes. Each
form carries a hidden `return_to=<slug>` field; the route's
`_invitation_redirect_url` helper consults `_REVERT_RETURN_TO` +
the special `"home"` slug to resolve the 303 target. Direct form
posts elsewhere (e.g. tests hitting the route without the form's
hidden field) fall back to `/operator/sessions/{id}/invitations`.

- **Revert to draft** posts to `/operator/sessions/{id}/revert`:
  - States 4 / 4W / 4Err / 5 / 6 (`is_validated`): via
    `next-action-revert-form`. Route dispatches to
    `lifecycle.invalidate_session(reason="operator_revert")` →
    `validated → draft`, audit `session.invalidated`.
  - States 7 / 8 / 9 (`is_ready`): via `next-action-pause-form`
    with hidden `confirm=true`. Route dispatches to
    `lifecycle.revert_session_to_draft` → `ready → draft`,
    audit `session.reverted_to_draft`. Instruments flip
    `accepting_responses = False`; responses are preserved.

## Right column

The right column is a `<aside class="next-action-status"
id="next-action-status">` block. It carries up to two layers,
stacked top-to-bottom:

1. **Signal lines** — inline icon-prefixed paragraphs (no
   background, no border). Up to four lines render depending on
   the data; they're driven by `super_failure`,
   `scheduled_activation_caption`, `auto_send_invites_caption`,
   and `auto_send_reminders_caption`. The signals are largely
   state-independent — they appear in any state when their
   source caption is non-None.
2. **Per-state status detail** — a heading + content block
   (checklist, issue list, or short status copy), keyed on the
   workflow state.

### Right-column content by state

The cell shows the per-state status detail. Any non-None signal
line (failure / scheduled-activation / auto-send invites / auto-
send reminders) renders above the detail; the per-signal
condition tables in the next section say when each is non-None.

| State | Per-state status detail |
| --- | --- |
| **1** (setup empty) | **Setup checklist** — heading + a single-row list (wraps on narrow viewports) with three entries: Reviewers / Reviewees / Instruments (all rules pinned). Each carries a ✓ or ✗ pill plus a deep link to its Operations-row page. |
| **2** (draft, not yet validated) | (no detail) |
| **3** (draft + validation errors) | **Validation issues** heading + pill row (error / warning / info counts) + per-issue list (rendered by `operator/partials/_next_action_issue_list.html`). |
| **4** (validated, no warnings, no invites) | **Status** heading + "Setup validated." |
| **4W** (validated + warnings) | "Setup validated." + per-warning pill row + the per-issue list inline so the operator sees what they're about to acknowledge before clicking the detour. |
| **4Err** (validated + errors, defensive) | Same shape as State 3 — Validation issues heading + pill row + per-issue list. |
| **5** (validated + invites generated) | Same as State 4 — "Setup validated." |
| **6** (validated + invites sent) | Same as State 4 — "Setup validated." |
| **7** (ready, no invitations yet) | (no detail) |
| **8** (ready, invites generated) | (no detail) |
| **9** (ready, invites sent) | (no detail) |

States 5 / 6 currently share State 4's status block; an
invite-counter / deadline aside can land as a follow-up.
States 7 / 8 / 9 have no detail block yet — invitation-status
counters are deferred.

### Signal lines

All signal lines live inside a `.next-action-signals` flex column
at the top of the aside. Each line is a
`.next-action-signal.next-action-signal--<tone>` paragraph with a
leading `.next-action-signal-icon` span. No banner background, no
border — the icon tone carries the urgency cue:

| Tone | Icon | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `error` | ✗ (error colour) | Workflow failure (Prepare or Activate). |
| `amber-warning` | ⚠ (warning colour) | Caption is configured but precondition not yet met. |
| `amber-grey` | ⓘ (muted text colour) | Caption is configured but inert (anchor-null, or post-skip one-shot). |
| `green` | ✓ (success colour) | Caption is effective (will fire / dispatch as scheduled). |

Lines render in this top-to-bottom order: failure first (most
urgent), then scheduled-activation, then auto-send invites, then
auto-send reminders.

#### Workflow-failure signal

Renders when `super_failure` is populated (i.e. the page was hit
with `?super_status=failed&super_button=<prepare|activate>&super_step=<step>&super_error=<msg>`).
Bold headline: **"Prepare session failed at the <step>."** or
**"Activate session failed at the <step>."** — the button name
comes from `super_failure.button`, and the step maps via
`_step_label_map` (`generate` → "Generate assignments",
`validate` → "Validate setup", `activate` → "Activate session",
`precondition` → "pre-flight check"). The error detail (when
present) renders inline below the headline. State 3 / 4Err
issue lists continue to render in the per-state detail block —
the failure signal doesn't suppress them.

#### Scheduled-activation signal

Built by `views.build_scheduled_activation_caption` from session
state × `sessions.scheduled_activate_at` (the operator-set Start
anchor):

| Session state | `scheduled_activate_at` | Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `draft` | unset | (none) |
| `draft` | set, in future | ⚠ "Scheduled activation at «X» — currently inactive: Prepare session before then or the schedule will skip." |
| `draft` | set, in past (after a skip) | ⓘ "Scheduled activation at «X» skipped — session was not validated." One-shot, clears on next operator interaction. |
| `validated` | unset | (none) |
| `validated` | set, in future | ✓ "System will auto-activate at «X». You can also click Activate now." |
| `ready` | (any — moot post-activation) | (none — the existing "Activated at «X»" treatment covers it) |

See `guide/segment_18G_scheduled_events.md` Part 1 for the
service-side contract (editor gate, persistence across
invalidation, fire-time skip semantics).

#### Auto-send invites signal

Built by `views.build_auto_send_invites_caption` from
`sessions.invite_offsets` + `scheduled_activate_at`:

| `invite_offsets` | `scheduled_activate_at` | Invitations created? | Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| empty / null | (any) | (any) | (none) |
| set | unset | (any) | ⓘ "Auto-send invites are configured but currently inactive — no Start to anchor against. They reactivate when Start is re-set." |
| set | set | no | ⚠ "Auto-send scheduled at «X» — currently inactive: create invitations before then or these will skip." |
| set | set | yes | ✓ "Auto-send scheduled at «X». System will dispatch automatically; you can also Send all now." |

#### Auto-send reminders signal

Built by `views.build_auto_send_reminders_caption` from
`sessions.reminder_offsets` + `deadline`:

| `reminder_offsets` | `deadline` | Session `ready`? | Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| empty / null | (any) | (any) | (none) |
| set | unset | (any) | ⓘ "Auto-send reminders are configured but currently inactive — no End to anchor against. They reactivate when End is re-set." |
| set | set | no | ⚠ "Auto-send reminders scheduled at «X» — currently inactive: activate the session before then or these will skip." |
| set | set | yes | ✓ "Auto-send reminders scheduled at «X». System will dispatch automatically; you can also Send reminders to incomplete now." |

### Manual-activate cancellation modal

Drives a browser confirm dialog on the Activate button, not a
right-column signal. The `manual_activate_cancellation` context
key is populated when a manual Activate click would cancel
pending auto-sends — i.e. when `scheduled_activate_at` is set in
the future or one or more `invite_offsets` entries still resolve
to a future fire moment. Payload: a count, a list of pending-fire
labels, and the prose ("N scheduled auto-send(s) will be
cancelled. Continue with manual activation?"). On confirm, the
existing `/workflow/activate` POST runs and `scheduled_activate_at`
clears in the same transaction; `invite_offsets` stays on the
column but becomes inert via the §8.2.2 anchor-null rule (per
`spec/lifecycle.md`).

## POST routes

Quick reference. Every action ultimately resolves to one of these
routes:

| Route | Service | Allowed prior state | Resulting state | Audit event |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /operator/sessions/{id}/workflow/prepare` | `assignments.replace_assignments` → `lifecycle.mark_validated` (on clean Validate) | `draft` or `validated` (`is_editable`) | `validated` (or `draft` on Validate errors; detour to host page with `prepare_confirm=responses` in the saved-response case) | `session.workflow_run_started` with `context.button="prepare_session"` + per-step events; `session.workflow_run_failed` on failure |
| `POST /operator/sessions/{id}/workflow/activate` | `lifecycle.activate_session` (re-validates first) | `validated` | `ready` (or detour to Validate page in the warnings case) | `session.workflow_run_started` with `context.button="activate_session"`; `session.workflow_run_failed` on failure |
| `POST /operator/sessions/{id}/assignments/generate` | `assignments.replace_assignments` | `draft` or `validated` | unchanged | `assignments.generated` |
| `POST /operator/sessions/{id}/activate` | `lifecycle.activate_session` | `validated` | `ready` | `session.activated` |
| `POST /operator/sessions/{id}/revert` (when `is_validated`) | `lifecycle.invalidate_session` | `validated` | `draft` | `session.invalidated` |
| `POST /operator/sessions/{id}/revert` (when `is_ready`) | `lifecycle.revert_session_to_draft` | `ready` | `draft` | `session.reverted_to_draft` |
| `POST /operator/sessions/{id}/invitations/generate` | `invitations.generate_invitations` | `validated` or `ready` (via `_require_validated_or_ready`) | unchanged | `invitations.generated` |
| `POST /operator/sessions/{id}/invitations/send-all` | `invitations.send_invitation` (per pending) | `validated` or `ready` | unchanged | per-invitation send events |
| `POST /operator/sessions/{id}/invitations/remind-incomplete` | `invitations.send_reminders_to_incomplete` | `ready` | unchanged | per-reminder send events |

The per-step `/assignments/generate` and `/activate` routes
remain alive even though the Workflow card no longer POSTs to
them directly. `/activate` is load-bearing for the Validate
page's warnings-detour banner; `/assignments/generate` has no UI
consumer but stays as a small surface for direct callers (test
fixtures, programmatic-validate hooks).

All `/activate` and `/revert` routes honour the form field
`return_to` against the `_REVERT_RETURN_TO` allowlist and 303 to
the corresponding child page; values outside the allowlist
(including `home`) 303 to `/operator/sessions/{id}`.
