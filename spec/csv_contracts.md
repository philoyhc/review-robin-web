# CSV contracts — spec

**The column shapes and parsing rules that govern every CSV the
operator extracts or uploads.** Multiple extract paths and five
import paths share a small library of primitives and a strict
round-trip guarantee on the four main roster-shaped pairs
(Reviewers, Reviewees, Relationships, Settings). Observers has a
wired importer but no extract tile yet.

When the code drifts from this spec, fix the code. Each extract
file pins its `HEADER` tuple as a module constant; each importer
calls `_missing_columns_issues` against the same names. Renaming
a column on either side is a deliberate spec edit.

Cross-references:

- **`app/services/extracts/`** — five extract modules + the shared
  `__init__.py` (`stream_csv`, `filename`).
- **`app/services/csv_imports.py`** — two roster importers
  (Reviewers, Reviewees) + the shared parsing primitives.

  round-trip). Split into `_serialize.py` (export) + `_apply.py`
  (import) + `_rows.py`, with `__init__.py` re-exporting the
  public surface.

## 1. CSV envelope (every file)

The envelope is the same shape on both sides — Python `csv.reader`
/ `csv.writer` defaults with one explicit choice:

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Encoding | UTF-8. Files with a BOM are tolerated by `decode_csv` (BOM stripped on read). |
| Delimiter | Comma. |
| Quoting | Python `csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL` — values containing comma, quote, or newline are double-quoted. |
| Line endings | `\r\n` on write (Python `csv` default); `\r\n` or `\n` accepted on read. |
| Header row | Always present, always first. |
| Empty trailing newline | Tolerated on read; emitted on write per Python defaults. |
| Filename convention | `{session_code}_{kind}.csv` via `extracts.filename(session, kind)`. E.g. `CS101_reviewers.csv`. |

The header row is the **contract** — every importer matches by
header name (case-sensitive), not by position. An extra column
the operator added in Excel is ignored; a missing required
column is a parse error.

---

## 2. Five extracts (export contracts)

Each extract module declares a `HEADER: tuple[str, ...]` module
constant. The serialiser yields the header first, then one tuple
per row in a deterministic order so re-export of the same session
is byte-stable.

### 2.1 Reviewers — `extracts/reviewers_extract.py`

| # | Column | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ReviewerName` | `reviewer.name` | Required on import. |
| 2 | `ReviewerEmail` | `reviewer.email` | Required on import. Used by the cross-table identity check and by `relationships.csv`'s FK. |
| 3 | `ReviewerTag1` | `reviewer.tag_1` | Optional on import. Empty cell ⇒ NULL. |
| 4 | `ReviewerTag2` | `reviewer.tag_2` | Same. |
| 5 | `ReviewerTag3` | `reviewer.tag_3` | Same. |

`Status` is **not** exported (reviewers carry a `status` column
internally but the roster CSV doesn't surface it; it is edited
on the Reviewers Setup page via the per-row Edit / bulk
inactivate-reactivate UI shipped in Segment 15F).

**Row order:** active rows first (`status='active'`), then by
`name`, then by `email`. Deterministic.

### 2.2 Reviewees — `extracts/reviewees_extract.py`

| # | Column | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `RevieweeName` | `reviewee.name` | Required. |
| 2 | `RevieweeEmail` | `reviewee.email_or_identifier` | Required. Mirrors the rosters-CSV header even though the underlying column is `email_or_identifier` (non-email cohorts still use this header). |
| 3 | `RevieweeTag1` | `reviewee.tag_1` | Optional. |
| 4 | `RevieweeTag2` | `reviewee.tag_2` | Optional. |
| 5 | `RevieweeTag3` | `reviewee.tag_3` | Optional. |
| 6 | `PhotoLink` | `reviewee.profile_link` | Optional. Rendered as a clickable link on the reviewer surface when populated. |

**Row order:** active rows first, then by `name`, then by
`email_or_identifier`.

### 2.3 Relationships — `extracts/relationships_extract.py`

Shipped 12A-3 PR 1. The pair-context round-trip.

| # | Column | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ReviewerEmail` | `reviewer.email` (FK) | Required. Resolved against the session's reviewers on import. |
| 2 | `RevieweeEmail` | `reviewee.email_or_identifier` (FK) | Required. Resolved against the session's reviewees on import. |
| 3 | `PairContextTag1` | `relationship.tag_1` | Optional. Consumed by the rule engine's `pair_context.tag1` predicate. |
| 4 | `PairContextTag2` | `relationship.tag_2` | Same → `pair_context.tag2`. |
| 5 | `PairContextTag3` | `relationship.tag_3` | Same → `pair_context.tag3`. |
| 6 | `Status` | `relationship.status` | Lowercase `active` / `inactive`. Defaults to `active` when omitted on import. |

**Row order:** active first, then by reviewer email, then by
reviewee identifier.

### 2.4 Responses — `extracts/responses_extract.py`

Shipped 12A-1 PR 4 + #781 polish; preamble + positional
instrument naming added in Segment 18D. Analysis-facing per-session
CSV — the consumer is an external analyst, not the app. No import
counterpart (responses are reviewer-generated, not
operator-uploaded).

The file has two parts:

1. **Preamble** — one block per instrument: a row carrying the
   instrument's positional name (`instrument_1`, `instrument_2`,
   … by instrument order), then one `FieldKey, HelpText` row per
   response field (a field dictionary). A blank row separates the
   preamble from the table. A session with no instruments emits
   no preamble and no gap.
2. **Data table** — the 21-column wide format below.

| Block | Columns |
|---|---|
| Reviewer identity (5) | `ReviewerName`, `ReviewerEmail`, `ReviewerTag1`, `ReviewerTag2`, `ReviewerTag3` |
| Reviewee identity (5) | `RevieweeName`, `RevieweeEmail`, `RevieweeTag1`, `RevieweeTag2`, `RevieweeTag3` |
| Instrument (2) | `InstrumentName` (the positional id `instrument_{n}` — the operator's typed name is not exported), `InstrumentShortLabel` |
| Field context (3) | `FieldKey`, `FieldLabel`, `ResponseType` |
| Value (1) | `Value` (empty cell ⇒ reviewer cleared the field) |
| Self-review (1) | `SelfReview` — uppercase `TRUE` / `FALSE` per Excel idiom. Computed via `is_self_review(reviewer, reviewee)` (case-insensitive email match; `FALSE` for non-email reviewee identifiers). |
| Lifecycle (3) | `SavedAt`, `SubmittedAt`, `Version` |
| Instrument flavour (1) | `InstrumentFlavour` — derived `per-reviewee` / `group-scoped` (Segment 13C / 18D). Appended last so the original 20-column indices stay stable for existing analyst pipelines. |

An analyst joins a preamble help text to its data column via the
shared `FieldKey`.

`SavedAt` / `SubmittedAt` are ISO 8601 carrying the **session
zone's** UTC offset (e.g. `2026-06-02T08:00:00+08:00`), via
`date_formatting.iso_in_zone` — see `spec/timezone_display.md`.

**Streaming:** the data-table query uses `yield_per(1000)` cursor
streaming so large sessions don't materialise every Response
row in memory. Row order: `(reviewer_id, reviewee_id,
instrument.order, field.order)`.

### 2.5 Audit events — `extracts/audit_events_extract.py`

Shipped 12B PR 1. No operator-facing tile (relocates to Sys Admin
under Segment 16A); the route `GET /export/audit_log.csv` is
live.

| # | Column | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `EventType` | `event_type` | One of the registered types in `EVENT_SCHEMAS` (`app/services/audit.py`). |
| 2 | `Severity` | `severity` | `info` / `warning` / `error` (from the canonical envelope). |
| 3 | `Summary` | `summary` | Human-readable one-liner. |
| 4 | `ActorEmail` | LEFT JOIN through `actor_user_id` → `users.email`. Empty cell ⇒ system-emitted event with no actor. |
| 5 | `CorrelationId` | `correlation_id` | Request-scoped UUID. |
| 6 | `CreatedAt` | `created_at` | ISO 8601 in **UTC** (`...+00:00`); naive readbacks (SQLite) normalised to UTC for dialect-stable output. The audit log is the deliberate UTC exception (`spec/timezone_display.md`) — unlike the other per-session extracts, this column is *not* localised to the session zone. |
| 7 | `DetailJson` | `json.dumps(detail, sort_keys=True)` | Empty cell when `detail is None`. |

**Row order:** `(created_at ASC, id ASC)`. **Streaming:**
`yield_per(1000)`.

### 2.6 Entity stats — `extracts/entity_stats_extract.py`

Shipped 18H Part 3. Two **bundle-only** CSVs — a Reviewer stats
file and a Reviewee stats file — added to the Zip-all bundle.
They are deliberately **not** offered as individual downloads and
have **no importer**: the round-trippable Reviewers / Reviewees
CSVs keep that role, and adding stats columns to them would break
the importer contract. The module exposes `build_entity_stats`
(not a streaming serialiser); it returns both header-led row lists
in one pass.

Each carries the plain roster shape (§2.1 / §2.2 columns) plus
aggregate response-activity columns, every metric reported as a
**Draft / Submitted** pair (`submitted_at` unset vs set). Only
responses with a non-empty value count. A group-scoped
instrument's fanned-out answer counts once per group for the
field / char metrics on the reviewer side; both member reviewees
are still credited under `RevieweesReviewed*`.

Reviewer stats extra columns: `RevieweesReviewedDraft/Submitted`
(distinct reviewees with ≥1 non-empty response),
`FieldsAnsweredDraft/Submitted`,
`RequiredFieldsAnsweredDraft/Submitted`,
`StringResponseCharsDraft/Submitted` (sum of `len(value)` over
`String`-typed fields). Reviewee stats extra columns:
`ReviewersDraft/Submitted` (distinct reviewers) plus the same
three field / char pairs.

### 2.7 Per-instrument responses — `extracts/responses_extract.py` (`serialize_responses_for_instrument`)

Shipped 18H Part 2. **Bundle-only** sibling files to the unified
Responses CSV — one ``{code}_instrument_{n}.csv`` per instrument,
named positionally to match the ``instrument_{n}`` vocabulary
used in §2.4's preamble and ``InstrumentName`` column. No
individual download tile; no importer.

Same 21-column long-format header as §2.4, so an analyst can
concatenate the per-instrument files and reconstruct the unified
file. Each file carries a single-instrument preamble (its field
dictionary), a blank-row gap, the header, then data rows scoped
to that instrument. **Sort order:** ``(RevieweeName → ReviewerEmail
→ field.order)`` — the reviewee-centric reading order. Group-scoped
instruments collapse the fan-out (one row per (reviewer, group,
field)) and post-sort by the composed group identity so a group's
rows cluster together.

### 2.8 Reviewer session summary — `extracts/responses_extract.py` (`serialize_reviewer_session_summary`)

Shipped 17B Phase 2 PR B. The **per-reviewer** participation
record downloaded from
`GET /me/sessions/{id}/summary.csv` as
``{code}_my_responses.csv``. Gated on whole-session submission
— a partial reviewer redirects to the dashboard. Reviewers
get this download from the surface (and the dashboard's
Session column once Reviewer Status is `submitted`).

Same 21-column long-format header as §2.4. The file leads with
a per-instrument preamble + field dictionary for every
instrument the reviewer responded on — instruments they
weren't assigned to (or that they have no `Response` rows on)
are omitted, so the file is narrower than the unified
Responses CSV. Group-scoped instruments collapse the same way
(one row per (this reviewer, instrument, group, field)).
Builds on the same `_response_row_tuple` factored out in §2.7
so a per-cell rename flows through to every file in this
family.

## 3. Four importers (input contracts)

### 3.1 Reviewers + Reviewees — `csv_imports.py`

Two functions: `parse_reviewer_csv(content: bytes) -> ParseResult`
and `parse_reviewee_csv(content: bytes) -> ParseResult`.

**Required columns:**

- Reviewers: `ReviewerName`, `ReviewerEmail`.
- Reviewees: `RevieweeName`, `RevieweeEmail`.

Missing-required → `ParseResult` carrying one `ValidationIssue`
per missing column, no rows. The route 303s back with a
banner-error.

**Per-row validation** (every importer):

| Rule | Detection |
|---|---|
| Required cell present | Empty `ReviewerName` / `ReviewerEmail` / `RevieweeName` / `RevieweeEmail` → per-row error. |
| Email format | `_parse_email` rejects malformed strings on the email columns. Reviewees skip this check when the cell isn't an email (non-email identifier). |
| Within-file duplicates | Same `ReviewerEmail` / `RevieweeEmail` twice → per-row error on the second occurrence. |
| Cross-table identity | `check_cross_table_identity` rejects a Reviewer + Reviewee with the same email (would break the self-review predicate). |

**Optional columns:** any of `ReviewerTag1..3`, `RevieweeTag1..3`,
`PhotoLink` may be absent. An absent column is `None` for every
row; an empty cell is `None` for that row.

**Save:** `save_reviewers(db, session, rows)` /
`save_reviewees(...)` wipe-and-replace within the session's
roster, then call `seed_display_fields_from_reviewees` for the
Reviewees side (idempotent display-field seeding off populated
`profile_link` / `tag_*` columns).

### 3.2 Relationships — `relationships.py`

`parse_relationship_csv(content, *, reviewer_emails,
reviewee_identifiers)` resolves the two FK columns against the
already-loaded session rosters. Required: `ReviewerEmail`,
`RevieweeEmail`. Optional: `PairContextTag1..3`, `Status`.

**Per-row validation:**

| Rule | Detection |
|---|---|
| Required cell present | Empty `ReviewerEmail` / `RevieweeEmail` → per-row error. |
| FK resolution | `ReviewerEmail` not in session's reviewers → per-row error. Same for `RevieweeEmail`. |
| Within-file duplicates | Same `(ReviewerEmail, RevieweeEmail)` pair twice → second occurrence rejected. |
| Status value | `Status` must be `active` / `inactive` (lowercase) or empty (defaults to `active`). |

**Save:** `save_relationships(db, session, rows)` wipe-and-replace,
then call `seed_display_fields_from_assignments` (legacy-named
helper that reads from `relationships.tag_N` post-15D PR 6b).

### 3.2b Observers — `csv_imports.py`

Shipped PR #1706. `parse_observer_csv(content: bytes) -> ParseResult`
and `save_observers(db, session, rows, *, user, correlation_id)`.

**Required columns:** `ObserverEmail`.
**Optional columns:** `ObserverName`, `ObserverTag1`.

**Per-row validation:**

| Rule | Detection |
|---|---|
| Required cell present | Empty `ObserverEmail` → per-row error. |
| Email format | `_parse_email` rejects malformed strings. |
| Within-file duplicates | Same `ObserverEmail` twice → second occurrence rejected. |

**Save:** `save_observers(...)` wipe-and-replace within the session's
observer roster. Emits `observers.imported` audit event on success.
Bulk delete: `delete_all_observers(db, session, *, user,
correlation_id)` — emits `observers.deleted_all`.

No extract counterpart yet — the Observers CSV download tile is not
yet exposed in the operator UI.

### 3.3 Settings — `session_config_io/` (two-phase apply)

The Settings CSV is **different in shape from the roster CSVs**:
instead of a flat record-per-row table, it's a `(field, value,
data_type)` triple per row covering every per-session setting in
one file.

**Header:** `field,value,data_type` (lowercase, always three cols).

**Row shape:**

```
session.name,Spring Review,String
session.deadline,2026-06-01T08:00:00+08:00,DateTime
email_template_overrides.invitation_subject,Please review your assigned reviewees,String
rtd.Long_text.data_type,Long_text,String
instruments[1].name,Default,String
instruments[1].display_fields[1].source_type,reviewee,String
session_rule_sets[Personal: Custom rule].description,…,String
field_labels.reviewer.tag_1,Cohort,String
```

The dotted / bracketed `field` paths route each row to a parser
that knows its target. See `serialize_session_config` for the six
sections (session-level → email templates → RTDs → instruments
→ session RuleSets → field labels) and their canonical
ordering.

**Two-phase apply contract:**

1. **Phase 1 — Parse + validate every row.** Collect every error
   into `ApplyResult.errors`. One bad row doesn't mask the next.
   No DB writes.
2. **Phase 2 — Apply the typed plan.** Wipe-and-replace within
   the affected section (e.g. all RTDs for a session, all
   instruments, all `session_rule_sets` rows minus seeded copies).
   Atomic transaction. On any apply error, raise; the caller's
   transaction handler rolls back.

If phase 1 finds errors, phase 2 is **not attempted** — the
`ApplyResult` carries `errors` and the route surfaces them.

`apply_session_config` is the inverse of `serialize_session_config`.

### 3.4 What's not an importer

- **Assignments.** Materialised derivative post-15D — no operator-
  facing CSV importer. The `manual` CSV path in `assignments.py`
  survives as a dev-diagnostic helper for test fixtures only.
- **Responses.** Reviewer-generated; no operator-facing importer.
- **Audit events.** System-emitted; no importer.

---

## 4. Round-trip stability contract

The four roster-shaped pairs (Reviewers, Reviewees,
Relationships, Settings) are **byte-stable** on round-trip:
`serialize(session) → write to file → read file → apply to
session → serialize` yields a byte-identical CSV.

Concrete guarantees the importers + serialisers maintain:

1. **Deterministic row order.** Active rows first, then by the
   first sort key documented per extract. Seeded RTDs and seeded
   RuleSets always emit in install order.
2. **Deterministic field order.** Section ordering pinned in
   `serialize_session_config`'s docstring + a golden-fixture
   unit test.
3. **Encoding parity.** UTF-8 in, UTF-8 out. BOM stripped on
   read, never emitted on write.
4. **Datetime normalisation.** Naive readbacks (SQLite without
   tzinfo) are normalised to UTC, then converted to the session's
   resolved display zone, and serialised as ISO 8601 carrying that
   zone's offset (`date_formatting.iso_in_zone`) — precise,
   dialect-stable, and round-trip-safe (any ISO 8601 offset parses
   back). The audit-events extract is the exception: it stays in
   UTC (`spec/timezone_display.md`).
5. **Vocabulary normalisation.** RTD `data_type` accepts both
   lowercase tokens (`long_text`) and capitalised model values
   (`Long_text`) on import; serialise emits the capitalised
   form. (12A-3 PR 3 fix.)
6. **Empty-string handling.** A `null` cell in storage is an
   empty CSV cell on serialise; an empty CSV cell on parse is
   `None`. No `"None"` strings, no `"null"` strings.
7. **Seeded entries are not re-emitted.** Seeded RTDs and seeded
   RuleSets auto-materialise on session create, so the export
   filters them out (re-emitting would either no-op or trip
   `uq_session_rule_set_session_name`).

The round-trip is asserted by
`tests/integration/test_apply_session_config.py::test_round_trip_byte_stable`
and per-entity round-trip tests in
`tests/integration/test_extracts_*.py`.

## 5. Shared parsing primitives

`app/services/csv_imports.py` exposes the helpers every importer
shares. Public surface:

| Helper | Role |
|---|---|
| `decode_csv(content: bytes) -> str` | UTF-8 decode + BOM strip. Single function so every importer gets identical encoding behaviour. |
| `_read_dict_rows(text: str)` | `csv.DictReader` wrapper with empty-line tolerance. |
| `_missing_columns_issues(fieldnames, required, source)` | Returns one `ValidationIssue` per missing required column. Called at parse time, before per-row iteration. |
| `_cell(row, key)` | Stripped string read; returns `""` when key absent. |
| `_none_if_blank(row, key)` | `None` when cell is empty / whitespace-only, else the stripped string. The canonical "optional cell" reader. |
| `_parse_email(value, *, field, row_number)` | Email validation with row-context error message. Used on `ReviewerEmail`, `RevieweeEmail` (when the cell is an email), and `ReviewerEmail` / `RevieweeEmail` in the Relationships importer. |
| `check_cross_table_identity(db, session_id, rows, *, side)` | Cross-table guard — rejects a Reviewer with the same email as a Reviewee in the same session. |

## 7. Implementation principles

1. **`HEADER` is the contract.** Each extract module pins a
   `HEADER: tuple[str, ...]` and the importer matches by header
   name. A column rename is a deliberate spec edit, not an
   accident.

2. **Wipe-and-replace, never merge.** Every importer replaces
   the section it owns within one transaction. Merge semantics
   would require per-row diffing the operator has no way to
   audit; replace is cleaner and matches the operator's mental
   model ("re-upload the file = re-set the state").

3. **Two-phase parse + apply (Settings).** Parse everything,
   collect every error, then apply or rollback. The operator
   sees the full validation report on a single submit rather
   than playing whack-a-mole.

4. **Streaming where it matters.** Responses + audit-events
   extracts use `yield_per(1000)` cursor streaming. Other
   extracts read into memory — roster sizes are bounded.

5. **Deterministic row order.** Every extract's row order is
   pinned in the module docstring and exercised by a unit test.
   Operators bisecting "what changed" across two snapshots
   benefit from the diff being clean.

6. **No header-position matching.** Operators add columns in
   Excel without thinking; the importer ignores extras. The
   importer matches required columns by name; missing-required
   surfaces as a parse-time error.
