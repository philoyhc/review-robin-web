# spec/

**Surface specifications and design intent.**

Answers the question: *what is X supposed to look like and behave
like?* Each file is a contract that the templates, services, and
tests should match. When the code drifts from a spec, the spec is
the canonical source — fix the code (or update the spec
deliberately as part of a feature change, never silently).

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `operator_map.md` | Operator-facing page surface — chrome, setup nav, lock card, per-page layout and affordances. |

Sibling folders:

- **`docs/`** — reference material about the running system (how
  things actually work today).
- **`guide/`** — forward-looking plans, todos, segment-by-segment
  workplans.
