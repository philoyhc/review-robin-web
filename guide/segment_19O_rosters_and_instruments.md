## Item 1 — Exclude self-reviews from the Link 3 column

### Opportunity

`spec/assignments.md` § *Self-review policy* names two supported ways to
suppress self-reviews. The first — *"Add a Link 2 (or Link 1) rule like
`reviewee.email IS DIFFERENT FROM reviewer.email`"* — **no operator can
reach.** `views/_instruments.py::new_model_usable_tags` returns
`tag1`/`tag2`/`tag3` for `reviewer` / `reviewee` / `pair_context` and no
email slot; the general Rule Builder that once offered the full grammar is
retired, route and template. The engine accepts `reviewer.email` and
`reviewee.email` (`ALLOWED_PREDICATE_FIELDS`); nothing authors them.
Found by Codex on #2381.

**It was designed away on a premise that no longer holds.** The 13A picker
omitted email deliberately — *"operator-authored rules don't reach for
email comparisons (the engine's `excludeSelfReviews` desugar handles that
case implicitly)"* (`app/web/views/_rule_builder.py`). Both halves then
went a day apart, in opposite directions: the picker retired **2026-05-25**
(`5aa0c9ed`), `excludeSelfReviews` was pinned `False` **2026-05-26**
(`8f8d336d`) — the same commit that wrote the policy naming the
now-unreachable rule. The only surviving affordance is post-generation:
materialize every self-review row, then deactivate it.

**But one objection is live, not archaeological**, and is the real reason
to answer rather than the retired comment above. `_band1.py` enforces it on
every Band 1 save (`:146-167`, and the seed at `:426-440`): *"The
per-instrument Self review toggle on the Assignments page is the sole
include / exclude surface; baking exclusion in at the rule-set level would
silently disable that toggle."*

### Decision

**A per-instrument flag, honored at materialization** — at the point in
`assignments/_generate.py:337-351` that already decides `pair_include`.

Read that branch precisely: `pair_include` is **not a skip**. It is the
value written to `Assignment.include` (`:450`), so today a self-review pair
on a session with `self_reviews_active=False` still gets a row. Honoring
the flag means **omitting the pair from `new_pairs`** — one `continue` —
which is a different edit with a consequence the skip framing hides, and
that consequence is in *Semantics*.

Why this is buildable where the banned flag is not: `_generate.py`
**already computes whole-group `is_self`** before that branch —
`self_review_groups` (`:314-332`) marks each group whose reviewer is one of
its own reviewees, built from the engine's full `result.pairs`. **Group
correctness is free**; nothing new expresses it.

**Answering `_band1.py`.** It is right that silently disabling a working
toggle is a regression. The toggle is not disabled here so much as *made
inapplicable*, and the cell must say so — "Excluded by rule" is the
objection's remedy, not a nicety. **If rung 4 slips, rung 3 must not
land.**

Rejected:

- **Email fields in the picker plus a pair predicate.** Pair-level, so on a
  group-scoped instrument it drops `(R, R)` and leaves the rest — worse than
  one member short, since `classify_self_review` identifies a self-review
  group *by finding that row* (`_self_review.py:122-128`), so the remainder
  stops counting as self-review at all.
- **`RuleSetOptions.excludeSelfReviews`, or the still-live
  `override_exclude_self_reviews` channel** (`_generate.py:304` →
  `engine.py:150-154`, resolving ahead of the pinned option). Both are the
  *desugar* stage, which carries both recorded hazards: it drops pairs
  **before** group composition (under-counting by one) and it is invisible.
  Honoring the flag after the fan-out avoids the first; rung 4 the second.

### Semantics

- **It sits in the Link 3 column for space, not because it belongs to the
  unit of review** (author, 2026-09-14). A **horizontal rule** below the
  Link 3 controls separates them, so the checkbox reads as a second thing
  in the same column rather than a third unit-of-review state. The rule is
  a `base.html` class, not an inline style — the column's existing 1px
  vertical separator (`--border-default`) is the sibling to match.
- **Default off**, and **takes effect at Generate** — Regenerate is the only
  write site for `Assignment` rows, so ticking the box leaves existing rows
  alone until the next Generate. The card says so.
- **Group mode drops the whole group**, individual mode the pair, both from
  the existing `is_self`.
- **Ticking the box after responses exist deletes them.** A pair dropped
  from `new_pairs` lands in `to_delete`, and `_materialise_one_instrument`
  deletes each row's `Response` rows before the row (`:434-438`). This needs
  no new guard: the diff already counts `responses_deleted` (`:369-378`) and
  the Prepare confirm card already spells it out
  (`next_action_card.html:89-97`). Rung 3 asserts it rather than adding to
  it.
- **A non-email reviewee identifier is never a self-review**
  (`is_self_review` returns `False` with no `@`), so the flag cannot drop an
  anonymous reviewee's row — the copy says *reviewed is the reviewer*, which
  is identity matching, not name matching.
- **The excluded rows read as excluded.** On Assignments → per-instrument
  status the **Self review** cell renders **"Excluded by rule"** in place of
  the count pill (author, 2026-09-14). Today it is a pill of
  `self_review_total` plus the include checkbox, the latter gated on
  `> 0` (`session_assignments.html:84-86`) — so a flagged instrument would
  otherwise read as a bare `0`, indistinguishable from a roster with no
  self-pairs. The checkbox needs no separate suppression; its guard already
  hides it. *None exist* and *none kept* must not share a rendering.

### Judgment calls — decided

- **Per-instrument, not per-session** (2026-09-14). The rule set and Link 3
  are both per-instrument; a session flag reinstates what 15B retired.
- **Reuse `SessionRuleSet.exclude_self_reviews`; add no column**
  (2026-09-14, corrected after reading the code). The column already exists
  (`app/db/models/session_rule_set.py:63`, `default=True`), is per-instrument
  in practice — Band 1 auto-manages one rule set per new-model instrument
  (`_band1.py:426`) — and already round-trips through session config IO
  (`_serialize.py:544`, `_apply_rule_set.py:47`) and the by-instrument
  extract (`by_instrument_extract.py:332`). The work is **removing the
  normalization**, not adding storage.
- **The checkbox writes no predicate** (2026-09-14). It is not sugar over a
  rule the operator could have written, so composing one would misdescribe
  it in the readback.
- **Turning the flag ON materializes an empty rule set; turning it OFF with
  no rule set is a no-op** (2026-09-14, rung 2). Band 1 only creates a
  `SessionRuleSet` once a Link 1 / Link 2 rule exists, so an untouched
  instrument has nowhere to store the flag. An empty rule set is
  output-identical to the synthetic Full Matrix schema, so this costs no
  assignment row — verified: the `revision_seed` difference is read only
  inside the quota-rule loop, which an empty rule set never enters. Not
  creating a row for an OFF write keeps untouched instruments clean, since
  `False` is the default and records nothing.
- **The checkbox label follows the Link 3 mode** (2026-09-14, rung 2):
  "individual" or "group", so the copy names what would actually be
  dropped.

### Blast radius (measured)

Measured 2026-09-14 at `8669849a`, before the first slice.

```
grep -rn "is_self_review(" app/ --include=*.py | grep -v "def " | wc -l      # 9
grep -rn "self_reviews_active" app/ --include=*.py --include=*.html | wc -l  # 21
grep -rln "_link3_\|link3_mode" app/web/templates | wc -l                    # 1

grep -rln "self_review\|self-review" tests/ --include=*.py | wc -l          # 51
```

Of the 18 spec/docs hits, the three this item commits to are in *Doc
impact*. The **51** test files are the figure to respect: self-review
classification is the engine's most cross-cut invariant, guarded by
`verify_self_review_classification` as a continuous gate.


*Corrected 2026-09-14 (`spec-writer` on `bb75e366`): first written as 10
and 106. The test command omitted `--include=*.py` and counted 55
`__pycache__/*.pyc` alongside the 51 real files — a guardrail is the wrong
place to overstate by double.*

### Status

**Closed 2026-09-14**, four rungs, four PRs. Intended versus done:

- **The mechanism landed as designed** and its load-bearing claim held under
  verification: `_diff_one_instrument` already computes whole-group `is_self`
  from the engine's full `result.pairs` before the `pair_include` branch, so
  honoring the flag there gives whole-group correctness for free, and a pair
  omitted from `new_pairs` is not re-added downstream.
- **Rung 1 was one deletion, not the two the ladder named, and the second
  would have been a bug.** Storage already existed
  (`SessionRuleSet.exclude_self_reviews`) and was being force-normalized to
  `False` on every Band 1 save — a heal for pre-#1452 rows that migration
  `d2e4f6a8c1b3` had already completed, so the re-write only discarded
  operator intent. But the ladder also said to drop the
  `exclude_self_reviews=False` seed: the mapped column is `default=True`, so
  that would have inverted the default for every new instrument, silent until
  rung 3. The seed stays.
- **Rung 2 found a hole in the storage decision.** Band 1 creates a rule set
  only once a Link rule exists, so an untouched instrument had nowhere to put
  the flag — and is the likeliest to want it. Turning it on materializes an
  empty rule set, verified output-identical to the synthetic Full Matrix
  schema; turning it off with no row is a no-op. Also: `base.html` is a
  generated-tool source, so the new `.col-divider` class desynced
  `tools/theme_*.html`.
- **Rung 4's premise was slightly wrong and the fix is better for it.** The
  plan assumed the Self review count is always `0` when the flag is set.
  Between ticking the box and the next Generate it is not, so the cell reads
  "Excluded by rule" only once the count is actually `0`; a
  flagged-but-not-yet-regenerated instrument keeps its real count and its
  toggle, which are still true and still actionable.
- **`spec/ui_elements.md` added to *Doc impact* at build.** The plan named the
  specs the behavior touches and missed the one the *primitive* touches.

**The defect pattern, stated because it repeated at every rung:** every error
was in prose *about* the code, never in reading what the code does. A
`server_default` cited on the wrong table, read off a grep hit's neighborhood
instead of its enclosing function. A test-file count doubled by `__pycache__`.
A "lands inert" claim contradicted by this plan's own judgment call two
sections above it. A spec drift reported in the prior session that was not
real. A rule set that could be created with no `.created` audit event. Four
`spec-writer` passes caught them; each was verified at `file:line` before
being fixed. *A row-scoped fix is not a claim-scoped fix.*

### PR ladder

1. **Unpin the existing flag.** No migration: drop the
   `exclude_self_reviews` re-normalization at `_band1.py:146-167` and the
   `exclude_self_reviews=False` seed at `:441`, so the column the model
   already carries stops being forced. Lands inert — nothing writes it yet
   and the engine still ignores it (`_session_rule_set_to_schema` hardcodes
   `excludeSelfReviews=False`). The PR body says what the column now means.
2. **The control.** Horizontal rule below the Link 3 controls, then the
   checkbox beneath it, reading and writing the column. Still no engine
   change; the PR body says so.
3. **Honor it at materialization.** The `_generate.py:337-351` loop omits
   the pair from `new_pairs` instead of writing `include=False`. Tests:
   individual, group, non-email identifier, a regenerate flipping the flag
   both ways, and the `responses_deleted` count on a tick-after-responses.
4. **Make the exclusion visible** — the "Excluded by rule" cell, per
   *Semantics*.

Rung 3 must not touch `RuleSetOptions`, `_session_rule_set_to_schema` or
`find_sample_in_scope_reviewee`. The three layers stay.

### Definition of done

- `SessionRuleSet.exclude_self_reviews` is no longer force-normalized, and
  a Band 1 save round-trips a `True` through config export/import
  unchanged.
- With it set, `replace_assignments` writes **no** self-review row: the
  `(R, R)` pair on an individual-scoped instrument, every member row of the
  group on a group-scoped one.
- `verify_self_review_classification` reports no drift after a regenerate
  with the flag set.
- A reviewee whose identifier is not an email is unaffected, asserted.
- The per-instrument **Self review** cell reads **"Excluded by rule"** when
  the flag is set, and a bare `0` when the roster simply has no self-pairs —
  asserted on both.
- `spec/assignments.md` § *Self-review policy* lists the shortcut and no
  longer names an affordance no operator can reach; its "enforced in three
  layers" paragraph is reconciled with the flag now being honored.
- `## Doc impact` section present and current
- `python3 tools/close_check.py 19O.1` exits 0; any warning adjudicated
- `spec-writer` run against the doc-impact specs; flags adjudicated
- `## Status` compacted to intended vs done; answered open questions collapsed
- `docs/status.md` row added; plan moved to `guide/archive/` + index row

### Open questions

1. ~~**How the excluded rows are shown.**~~ **Answered by the author
   2026-09-14: "Excluded by rule", replacing the count pill.** See
   *Semantics*.
2. ~~**Whether Link 3 is the right home**~~ **Answered by the author
   2026-09-14: yes, purely for space.** It is not a unit-of-review setting
   and is not presented as one — a horizontal rule separates it from the
   Link 3 controls above. See *Semantics*.

### Out of scope

- **Adding email to the Link 1 / Link 2 picker vocabulary.** Rejected above
  as a mechanism; out of scope as a change in its own right.
- **Restoring the general Rule Builder.** Retired at Wave 5 Gap 7 with the
  library tier; nothing here argues it back.
- **Changing `RuleSetOptions.excludeSelfReviews`.** The policy stands.

### Doc impact

- `spec/assignments.md` — § *Self-review policy* gains the shortcut as a supported affordance, drops the unreachable Link-rule claim, and reconciles its "enforced in three layers" paragraph (Item 1).
- `spec/instruments.md` — the Link 3 / *Unit of review* material gains the control and its interaction with Generate (Item 1).
- `spec/ui_elements.md` — §10 gains the `.col-divider` primitive the control is separated by (Item 1).
- `guide/deferred_consolidated.md` — the Part A entry is lifted into this plan and deleted (Item 1).
- `docs/status.md` — row when the item closes (Item 1).
