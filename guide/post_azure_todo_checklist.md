# Post-Azure to-do checklist

**Opened 2026-09-08 (Segment 19G Item 10).** Things that must happen
**once the institutional Azure deployment has concluded** — provisioned,
deployed, serving, verified — and that nothing in the repository will
otherwise remind anyone about.

**Why this file rather than `docs/deployment_nus.md`.** That runbook is
the migration procedure and will be rewritten repeatedly as details are
settled with IT; an item parked in a section that is about to be
rewritten is an item about to be lost. This file is small, stable and
has one job: survive until the deployment is over. Its items move into
the runbook, a spec, or a segment plan when they are done — or when the
runbook stops moving.

**How an item earns a place here.** It is *blocked on the deployment
itself*, not merely unscheduled. Work that is simply not next belongs in
`guide/todo_master.md` or `guide/deferred_consolidated.md`; work waiting
on a host belongs here. Each item names what to do, where to do it, and
**how to tell it is done** — a checklist item nobody can settle is a
note, not a task.

**This is not a runbook.** It does not describe how to deploy. It
describes what is owed *after* deploying, in an order nobody has fixed
yet.

## 1. Run the visibility-grid audit against real data, before any reviewee-facing window opens

**Status:** open. Blocked on the deployment.

**What.** Sign in as a sys admin and read the **Visibility grid audit**
card on `/operator/sys-admin/sessions`.

**Why it cannot wait, and why it cannot be done now.** The card exists to
find `instrument_view_policies` rows written *before* the Settings-CSV
import learned to refuse an illegal cell (Segment 19C Item 9, PR #2188).
The guard is prospective: a bad row written before it is still stored,
and `resolve_mode` honours it like any other. The cell that matters is a
**reviewee** grant on **Session ongoing** — a reviewee reading responses
while the review is still running.

It has only ever run against fixtures. On a database with almost no rows
a green card means *"no rows here"*, not *"no bad rows"*, so the check
written specifically to find pre-existing bad data has so far produced no
evidence about pre-existing bad data. Only real data settles it.

**Before any reviewee-facing window opens**, because that is the moment
a bad row stops being a latent defect and becomes a disclosure.

**Done when.** The card has been read on the deployed workspace with
real sessions present, and either it lists no findings — recorded with
the date and roughly how many instruments were in scope, since a green
card over three instruments proves little — or each finding has been
resolved by the operator who owns that session, on that instrument's
Band 3 editor. The card is read-only by design; clearing a cell is a
judgment about a live review and does not belong to whoever runs the
check.

**Where this came from.** `guide/archive/segment_19C_refinements.md`
Item 10 planned the first real run and recorded it in the item. The item
then closed and was archived, and the 08sep assessment §5 carried the
weakness while the instruction itself lived nowhere a deployer would
look — which is the failure this file exists to stop repeating.
