## Goal

A deliberate, end-to-end work-through of the **operator workflow**
— the path a session travels from creation through setup,
preparation, activation, the review window, and close-out. The
super-button / Workflow card (Segment 15E) consolidated several
lifecycle actions into one stepper; that consolidation traded away
some intermediate states the operator used to be able to inspect.
18F revisits the whole journey, fixes the concrete regressions,
and — importantly — **pre-positions** the workflow so the later
scheduling work (18G) and the post-MVP participant model
(segments 21+) slot in cleanly rather than each re-litigating the
lifecycle.

This is a workflow / UX / lifecycle segment, not a schema segment.
Where it needs columns, it rides **18G Part 0** (the schema
pre-positioning slice, formerly the 13F scheduled-lifecycle audit).

## Why now / why a segment

- **A concrete regression surfaced.** Because the super-button
  absorbed Validate → Generate → Activate into one action, an
  operator cannot preview the reviewer surface for a specific
  reviewer until *after* activation — and once a session is
  activated, the path to reviewers actually seeing their assigned
  cases is short (only the invitation send stands between).
  There is no longer a safe window: "assignments exist and are
  inspectable, but nothing is live." Part 1 restores that window.
- **The workflow deserves one holistic pass.** Rather than
  patching the super-button regression in isolation, 18F is the
  place to walk the whole operator journey once, catalogue the
  rough edges, and decide the shape of the lifecycle before
  18G layers time-based automation on top of it.
- **Pre-positioning pays compound interest.** 18G (scheduled
  events) and the participant-model arc (segments 21+) both
  assume a lifecycle they can hang triggers and roles off. If 18F
  settles the lifecycle's seams now, those segments consume a
  stable workflow instead of reshaping it.

## Scope (sketch)

The exact part list is drafted at scoping time. Part 1 is
committed; the rest of the segment is the holistic work-through
that will surface further parts.

### Part 1 — Split the super-button: "Prepare" + "Activate" — shipped 2026-05-20

The Workflow card revamp landed: the super-button is gone,
replaced by a dedicated `POST /workflow/prepare` route (Generate
+ Validate) and a solo `POST /workflow/activate` route (Activate
only). The card itself moved to a 50/50 column grid with two
rows of buttons in the left column — Row 1 (prep): Revert ·
Prepare · Create invites; Row 2 (run): Send invites · Activate ·
Send reminders · Close session (last is an inert placeholder
until the `expired` lifecycle work). The reconcile-detour
saved-response confirmation
migrated onto Prepare; the warnings detour on Activate is
preserved. State cascade renumbered to 10 stable IDs (1, 2, 3,
4, 4W, 4Err, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9); States 5 / 6 (validated +
invitations) render in the cascade but stay unreachable until
Part 2 relaxes the `_require_ready` invitation gate. Audit
events bracket each button's run with
`context.button="prepare_session"` or `"activate_session"`.
Spec rewritten in `spec/workflow_card.md`; tests in
`tests/integration/test_workflow_super_button.py` rewritten for
the split. Suite green (1929 passed), ruff clean.

The remainder of this section is the original Part 1 rationale,
retained for context.

**The problem.** The Workflow-card super-button runs Validate →
Generate → Activate as one action. Reviewer-surface previews need
the assignment pairs to exist (generation must have run), so today
preview is impossible until activation — at which point the
session is live and reviewers are one invitation-send away from
seeing their cases. The operator never gets a "generated but not
live" window to preview in.

**The decision (2026-05-19): Option A — split the action in two.**

- **"Prepare"** runs **Validate + Generate**. After Prepare the
  session still sits in a pre-activation state (`draft` /
  `validated`): assignment pairs are materialised and the
  reviewer surface is fully previewable, but nothing is live —
  reviewers cannot reach their surfaces and no invitations have
  gone out. Generation has no outbound side effects (it only
  materialises `assignments` + `responses` rows), so running it
  before activation is safe.
- **"Activate"** stays the single, deliberate point of no return
  — the `→ ready` transition, unchanged.

**Why Option A over Option B (an "opening" gate after Activate).**
The opening gate gates *response acceptance*, not *visibility* /
*previewability*, so it would not by itself give the operator a
window where reviewers definitely cannot see their cases. It also
adds a third lifecycle concept. Option A maps the preview window
onto a state that already exists (pre-activation) and keeps the
invariant "nothing is live until Activate." The opening gate idea
is **retired entirely** (2026-05-19): the decoupling it aimed at —
invitations out first, reviewing starts synchronously — is
delivered instead by **Part 2** below (Activated-as-gate +
invitations from the Prepared state) and **18G's scheduled
activation**, with no separate gate within `ready`.

**Sketch of the change.**
- The Workflow-card stepper splits the collapsed forward action
  into a `Prepare` button (Validate + Generate) and the existing
  `Activate session` button. The five-stage stepper row and the
  ten-state cascade in `spec/workflow_card.md` are revised
  accordingly.
- The reviewer-surface preview (Previews / Reviewer Experience
  Preview hub) becomes reachable once Prepare has run — i.e. once
  the instruments have generated pair sets — instead of requiring
  `ready`.
- No schema change expected: `validated` already exists; Generate
  already runs as its own service. This is a Workflow-card +
  routing + preview-gating change.

**Decisions (2026-05-19).**
- **No status relabel.** The `validated` state keeps its existing
  displayed label, "Validated" — *not* renamed to "Prepared".
  Because `validated` already entails "assignments generated"
  (today's super-button runs Generate → Validate → `mark_validated`,
  and the codebase nowhere assumes `validated` means "not yet
  generated"), the existing state display is accurate after Prepare
  runs. The button reads "Prepare" while the resulting state pill
  reads "Validated" — a mild vocabulary gap, but not worth a relabel
  or a copy sweep. No change to `SessionStatus` and no change to
  `app/services/lifecycle_display.py`.
- **"Prepare" button body text.** The Workflow-card body copy for
  the Prepare action explains it as something like: *"Prepare the
  session — generate the assignments and validate that the setup
  is ready for prime time."* Final wording settled at PR scoping;
  the intent is that the operator reads "Prepare" as the combined
  generate-plus-validate step, so the "Validated" state label
  needs no defence.

### Part 2 — Pre-activation invitations + reviewer pre-open / closed states — shipped 2026-05-20

Phase A — invitation gate + reviewer pre-open page — landed. The
`_require_ready` route guard renamed to
`_require_validated_or_ready` and relaxed to accept either
state, so `POST /invitations/generate` /
`POST /invitations/send-all` (and the per-row variants) now
work from Validated. The Workflow card's State 5 / State 6
branches in the cascade are now reachable and have their own
per-state body copy:

- State 5 (Validated, invites generated, none sent): *"Invitations
  are ready to send. Send them ahead of Activation to notify
  reviewers, or Activate now and send afterwards."*
- State 6 (Validated, invites sent): *"Reviewers have been
  notified that the review will open. Activate the session when
  you're ready to receive responses."*

The Create-invites and Send-invites buttons in Row 2 of the card
became live from Validated as well as Ready (the
`_invitations_actionable` predicate now reads `is_validated or
is_ready`); Send-reminders stays Ready-only.

A new reviewer **pre-open** page renders at
`GET /reviewer/sessions/{id}/{position}` when the session is not
yet `ready`. Before 18F Part 2 the surface 403-d in that state;
now it returns the new `reviewer/pre_open.html` template (under
the reviewer chrome), with the session name in the h1 and the
deadline / zone shown when one is set. Reviewers who follow an
invitation token to a Prepared session see "review opens later"
instead of a 403 or an empty form.

The reviewer **closed** state stays on the existing surface
template — its "this session is no longer accepting responses"
banner already covers the post-window UX (and crucially keeps
the existing `responses_visible_when_closed` toggle working so
reviewers can still see their saved responses after the
deadline). A dedicated closed.html was considered and dropped on
those grounds.

Phase B — edit-after-invite confirm guard — **deferred** to a
follow-up. The simpler mental model the operator already has is
that editing setup reverts the session to draft via
`invalidate_if_validated`; the State-cascade transition is
self-evident in the Workflow card. A confirmation modal can land
later if pilot feedback asks for one.

Tests: `tests/integration/test_invitations.py` gains three new
cases (Create invites from Validated succeeds, Send invites from
Validated succeeds, reviewer pre-open page renders). Suite green
(1932 passed); ruff clean.

The remainder of this section is the original Part 2 rationale,
retained for context.

**Original goal.** Support the scenario: an operator sends a notification
email to every reviewer *before* the session opens — "the review
opens for responses at «future time»" — and a reviewer who clicks
through lands on a page telling them the review is scheduled and to
come back later. After the review window, a reviewer who returns
sees a "this review is now closed" page.

**The model — Activated-as-gate, no separate opening gate.** The
`draft → ready` **Activate transition is the open event**: a
session is *open for responses* exactly when it is `ready`. There
is **no separate "opening" gate within `ready`** and **no new
`SessionStatus` value** — Activation itself is the gate, and
(in 18G) the activation can be scheduled. This is the call that
retires the old "opening gate" idea; see 18G's Part 3, now
"Scheduled activation".

**Why the current implementation precludes the scenario.** Two
gaps, both addressed here:

1. **Invitations are `ready`-gated.** `invitations.generate` /
   `send-all` / single-send all call `_require_ready`
   (`app/web/routes_operator/_operations.py`), which 409s unless
   the session is `ready`. So no notification email can go out
   before the session is open.
2. **No reviewer pre-open state.** Because a reviewer can't be
   invited before `ready` today, the reviewer surface has no
   "invited, but not open yet" rendering.

The reviewer **closed** state, by contrast, *substantially exists*
already — the surface computes per-instrument `accepting` /
`any_accepting`, and `lifecycle.observe_deadline` lazily closes
instruments at the deadline; the surface renders read-only when
nothing is accepting. Part 2 mostly adds an explicit "this review
is now closed" banner over that existing machinery.

**Scope sketch.**
- **Relax the invitation gate.** Allow `invitations.generate` /
  `send-all` / single-send to run while the session is `validated`
  (Prepared), not only `ready` — the small `_require_ready`
  change. The Workflow-card "Create invites" / "Send invites"
  stepper stages become available from the Prepared state.
- **Reviewer pre-open surface.** When a reviewer follows an
  invitation to a session that is `validated` (Prepared, not yet
  activated), render a "the review is scheduled to open — come
  back later" page instead of the response form. Routed from the
  invitation-token landing and the `/reviewer/sessions/{id}` /
  surface routes.
- **Reviewer closed surface.** A clear "this review is now
  closed" page for the post-window / `expired` period, over the
  existing not-accepting machinery.
- **Edit-after-invite hazard.** Sending invitations while
  `validated` and then editing setup flips `validated → draft`
  (`lifecycle.invalidate_if_validated`) with invitations already
  out. Part 2 adds a confirm / warning guard so the operator
  isn't surprised.

**Schema note.** The *precise* "opens at «future time»" wording
needs a stored open time — that is **18G's `activate_at` column**
(scheduled activation). Part 2 builds the *states* (invites-out-
while-Prepared, the pre-open page, the closed page); until 18G
lands `activate_at`, the pre-open page shows a generic "not open
yet" message rather than a specific time.

### Part 3+ — Holistic workflow work-through (to be catalogued)

A walk of the full operator journey, cataloguing rough edges and
deciding fixes. Candidate areas to assess at scoping (not yet
committed parts):

- Whether the Workflow card's state cascade still reads cleanly
  once Prepare/Activate are distinct.
- The Validate ↔ Generate ↔ preview ↔ Activate ordering and the
  affordances between them.
- Re-preparation after a setup edit (the reconcile path —
  `spec/reconciling_regeneration.md` — and how the card surfaces
  it).
- Any lifecycle seams the participant-model arc (segments 21+)
  will need — recorded as pre-positioning notes, not built here.

## Revamped Workflow card — proposed layout, states, and buttons (draft for planning)

> **Status:** Draft — captured for planning so the spec rewrite
> at PR time has a target. Final wording, exact pill copy, and
> the warnings-detour mechanics settle at PR scoping.

>
> **Implementation scoping (decided 2026-05-20).** Two PRs:

### Layout

The card uses a **55% / 45%** column split
(`grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 11fr) minmax(0, 9fr)`) — the
left column takes a little more than half so the four-button run
row (once Close session is live) doesn't crowd.
The role of each column is unchanged from today's spec — the
left column carries the body copy and the action buttons, the
right column carries the per-state status aside (validation
issues, invitation counts, deadline). The buttons stay where
they live now (left column); the only structural change vs
today is that they form **two rows** instead of one
five-button row, with both rows filling the left column's
width:

```
┌── Workflow (H2) ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌─ .next-action-main (55%) ──┐ ┌─ .next-action-status (45%)┐ │
│ │ <p>State-specific body</p> │ │ State-specific status /  │ │
│ │                            │ │ errors aside.            │ │
│ │ ┌── prep-actions row ───┐  │ │                          │ │
│ │ │ Revert │ Prepare │ Cr-│  │ │                          │ │
│ │ │ to draft│ session│ inv│  │ │                          │ │
│ │ └────────────────────────┘  │ │                          │ │
│ │ ┌── run-actions row ────┐   │ │                          │ │
│ │ │ Send │ Activate│ Send│Cl│ │ │                          │ │
│ │ │ inv- │ session │ rem-│os│ │ │                          │ │
│ │ │ ites │         │ inde│e │ │ │                          │ │
│ │ └─────────────────────────┘ │ │                          │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────┘ └──────────────────────────┘ │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

(Each button takes `1 / button_count` of the left column's
width: Row 1's three buttons are 33.33% of the left column;
Row 2's four buttons are 25%.)

- **Left column — body + two action rows.** **Row 1 (prep
  phase):** Revert to draft · Prepare session · Create invites
  — the "before reviewers see anything" actions. **Row 2 (run
  phase):** Send invites · Activate session · Send reminders ·
  Close session — the "reviewers are now in the loop" actions.
  Both rows render in every state; per-state styling drives
  which buttons are Primary / Secondary / inert.
- **Right column — per-state status aside.** Unchanged role
  from the current spec: validation issue list in error
  states, invitation counts / deadline in run states, the
  reconcile-detour confirmation banner when fired, the
  super-button failure banner when fired.
- State-specific failure banners stay above the two-column
  grid (same convention as today).
- Below the ~720 px responsive breakpoint the right column
  drops below the left (same convention as today), so the
  reading order is: body → prep row → run row → status aside.

> **Close session — placeholder.** Row 2 ships with the Close
> session slot rendered as an inert placeholder (`<button
> disabled aria-disabled="true">`); its behaviour lands later
> alongside the `expired` lifecycle status work that makes "end
> the review window" a distinct lifecycle step rather than an
> alias for Revert. The slot stays in the grid now so the
> eventual primary doesn't shift the layout.

### Button vocabulary

Both rows live in the **left column** (see Layout above). "Row"
below is the visual row within the left column — not a separate
card column.

| Button | Row | POST | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revert to draft | 1 (prep) | existing revert route | `ready → draft` or `validated → draft`, keeping responses. |
| Prepare session | 1 (prep) | new `/workflow/prepare` (Generate + Validate) | replaces the 15E super-button's pre-Activate steps; lands in `validated` on clean validation, stays in `draft` on errors. |
| Create invites | 1 (prep) | `/invitations/generate` | idempotent — creates one row per assigned active reviewer not yet invited. Live from **Validated** (per Part 2's invite-gate relaxation). |
| Send invites | 2 (run) | `/invitations/send-all` | sends every unsent `Invitation`. Live from Validated. |
| Activate session | 2 (run) | `/workflow/activate` (now solo, not a super-button) | `validated → ready`, opens every instrument, emits `session.activated`. |
| Send reminders | 2 (run) | `/invitations/remind-all` | nudges reviewers with outstanding responses. |
| Close session | 2 (run) | _(placeholder until `expired` lifecycle status lands)_ | Renders inert in the Row 2 slot today so the eventual primary doesn't shift the grid; the route + behaviour ship later. |

### State machine cascade (proposed)

```
if is_setup_empty:                              → State 1
elif is_draft:
    if validation_summary.has_errors:           → State 3
    else:                                       → State 2
elif is_validated:
    if invitations.none:
        if has_unacknowledged_warnings:         → State 4W
        else:                                   → State 4
    elif invitations.generated_not_sent:        → State 5
    else (invitations.sent):                    → State 6
elif is_ready:
    if invitations.none:                        → State 7
    elif invitations.generated_not_sent:        → State 8
    else (invitations.sent):                    → State 9
```

(Ten states, same count as the current spec but rebalanced
around Prepare / Activate as distinct buttons and around the
new pre-activation invite states.)

### Per-state body copy (proposed)

| State | Trigger | Body copy (placeholder wording — refine at PR time) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | `is_setup_empty` | "Session not fully set up. Make sure that reviewers, reviewees, relationships (optional), and instruments have been set up before continuing." |
| **2** | `is_draft`, no validation errors | "Run **Prepare session** — generates the assignment pairs and validates that the setup is ready for prime time. Nothing goes live until you activate." |
| **3** | `is_draft`, validation errors | "Validation didn't pass. Resolve the errors and re-run Prepare. The issue list is in the right column." |
| **4** | `is_validated`, no invitations | "Setup is prepared and the reviewer surface is previewable. Create invites and send them ahead of Activation, or Activate to receive responses." |
| **4W** | `is_validated`, warnings | Same as 4 plus help-line: "{N} warning(s) — review on Validate before activating." |
| **5** | `is_validated`, invites generated, none sent | "Invitations are ready to send. Send them ahead of activation to notify reviewers, or activate now and send afterwards." |
| **6** | `is_validated`, invites sent | "Reviewers have been notified that the review will open. Activate the session when you're ready to open responses." |
| **7** | `is_ready`, no invitations | "Session is open for responses. Create invites and send them so reviewers know they can start." |
| **8** | `is_ready`, invites generated, none sent | "Session is open. Send the prepared invitations so reviewers know they can start." |
| **9** | `is_ready`, invites sent | "Session is open. Send reminders if reviewers fall behind." (Closing the review window is by Revert in this first pass; a dedicated Close action lands with the `expired` lifecycle work.) |

### Workflow stepper — proposed button matrix

`Pri` = Primary live, `Sec` = Secondary live, `—` = inert
(rendered in Secondary style, `disabled aria-disabled="true"`).
Revert / Close never promote to Primary — they're recovery /
close-out paths, not the next forward step.

**Row 1 (prep) — Revert · Prepare · Create invites**

| Button | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4W | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revert to draft | — | — | — | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec |
| Prepare session | — | **Pri** | **Pri** | Sec | Sec | Sec | Sec | — | — | — |
| Create invites | — | — | — | **Pri** | **Pri** | Sec | Sec | **Pri** | Sec | Sec |

**Row 2 (run) — Send invites · Activate · Send reminders · Close session**

| Button | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4W | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Send invites | — | — | — | — | — | **Pri** | Sec | — | **Pri** | Sec |
| Activate session | — | — | — | **Pri** | **Pri** (→ warn detour) | **Pri** | **Pri** | — | — | — |
| Send reminders | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | **Pri** |
| Close session | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

(`Create invites` is idempotent, so it remains Secondary-live
after the first generation in case the roster gains an
uninvited reviewer; the matrix above pins it at Sec / Pri based
on whether *all* currently-eligible reviewers are already
invited. `Send invites` follows the same shape on already-sent
invites. Both detail behaviours stay the same as the current
spec.)

### Open clarifications for PR scoping

- **Body-copy phrasing.** Wording above is placeholder; refine
  against the existing copy register (`spec/workflow_card.md`
  §"Per-state body copy" is the style anchor).
- **Status aside content.** The right column's role is
  unchanged from today (validation issues, invite counts,
  deadline). Decide whether the new pre-activation invite
  states (4 / 5 / 6 with invites generated / sent) introduce
  any new aside content, or just re-use the existing
  "invitations created / sent" counters.
- **State 6 → 9 jump.** Activating from State 6 (invites
  already sent in Validated) lands in State 9 directly — the
  right-column status aside should make that consequence clear
  before the click.
- **Reconcile detour preservation.** The saved-response
  confirmation detour (today on the super-button) attaches to
  the new **Prepare session** button. Same mechanics, same
  banner — moved off Activate.

## Hard dependencies

- **Part 1** is self-contained — no dependency beyond the
  existing Validate / Generate / Activate services and the
  Workflow card.
- **Part 2** is self-contained at the manual level; the *scheduled*
  activation that fills in the "opens at «time»" wording is
  **18G's Scheduled activation** (Part 3 there) — 18F Part 2
  builds the states, 18G adds the schedule.
- The broader work-through coordinates with **Segment 18G**
  (scheduled events): 18G's scheduled activation and auto-send
  assume the Activated-as-gate model 18F settles. 18F should land
  first; 18G consumes its result.

## Out of scope

- Time-based automation of any kind — auto-archive, scheduled
  activation, auto-send invitations, scheduled reminders. All of
  that is **Segment 18G**. 18F Part 2 builds the lifecycle states
  those triggers fire against; it does not build the triggers.
- The participant-model lifecycle redesign (segments 21+) —
  18F only records pre-positioning notes for it.

## Doc impact

When parts ship:

- `spec/workflow_card.md` — the Prepare/Activate split: the
  stepper row, the ten-state cascade, the per-state copy; the
  invite stages becoming available from the Prepared state.
- `spec/lifecycle.md` — assignment generation runs pre-activation
  and the reviewer surface is previewable from that point;
  invitations sendable from `validated`; Activation is the
  "opens for responses" event (Activated-as-gate, no separate
  opening gate).
- `spec/reviewer-surface.md` — the new pre-open ("scheduled to
  open") and closed ("review now closed") reviewer states.
- `spec/operations_pages.md` / `spec/preview_hub.md` — the
  preview becomes reachable once Prepare has run; the Invitations
  surface is usable from the Prepared state.
- `docs/status.md` timeline entry per Part.
- `guide/todo_master.md` updated.

## Working notes

- _(placeholder for decisions during PR scoping)_
- **Lead, don't trail.** 18F lands before 18G — the scheduling
  work hangs off the lifecycle this segment settles.
