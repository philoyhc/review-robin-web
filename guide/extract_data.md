# Extract data — new Operations tab + Session Home card split

> **Stub created 2026-05-29.** Captures the plan to split the
> current Session Home "Extract data" card into two surfaces:

## Why this exists

The Session Home **Extract data** card today is a one-shape
download grid: one CSV per entity (Reviewers / Reviewees /
Relationships / Session settings / Responses) plus a Zip-all
bundle. It conflates two jobs:

1. **Setup data** — Reviewers / Reviewees / Relationships /
   Session settings. These are the things an operator
   originally uploaded (or could re-upload via Quick Setup).
   The natural use case is **portability**: clone a session,
   hand off to a colleague, archive a snapshot.
2. **Response data** — what reviewers produced during the
   session. The natural use case is **analysis**: pivot in
   Excel, load into pandas, slice by reviewer / reviewee /
   instrument.

Today's card serves (1) well — every row round-trips through
Quick Setup unmodified (18N PR 5 closed the last gap). It
serves (2) only at the single-shape level: one giant
denormalised Responses CSV. Operators who want to analyse
"what each reviewer said across all instruments", or "what
each reviewee got across all reviewers", end up doing the
pivot in Excel because the export forces them to.

Splitting the surface lets each side specialise: the card
stays focused on porting, and a dedicated **Extract data**
page handles response-data shaping with three lenses
(instrument / reviewer / reviewee).

The aim of the new page is **not analysis** — it's to **shape
the data so that offline analysis is easier**. No charts, no
in-app pivots. Just CSVs cut along the dimension the operator
asks for.

## Recommended end state

### Session Home — rename "Extract data" → "Extract setup"

The card stays where it is (right column of Session Home,
two-column internal layout). Its row list shrinks to the
porting-shaped CSVs only, and the column placement mirrors
Quick Setup's slot layout so the two cards read the same way:

```
Extract setup
  Reviewers         Relationships
  Reviewees         Session settings
                    Zip all  (the four CSVs above)
```

**Drop the Responses row.** It moves to the new tab. The
**Zip-all** row stays — but bundles **only the four setup
CSVs** (`{code}_setup.zip`). This matches the card's
repositioned purpose (porting / cloning) and aligns 1:1 with
the **Apply Settings CSV** input on Quick Setup: what the card
exports is exactly what Quick Setup can ingest.

The card stays interactive in every lifecycle state (no
lock-card wrap), same as today.

### Operations strip — new "Extract data" tab after "Responses"

```
Operations:  Assignments  Validate  Previews  Invitations  Responses  Extract data
```

Lives at `/operator/sessions/{id}/extract-data`. Behaves like
the other Operations pages (read-mostly, no lock card, breadcrumbs
via `operator_session_child("Extract data")`).

### Page interaction model

Two interaction shapes coexist on the page:

- **Per-lens configure + download.** The "By instrument" /
  "By reviewer" / "By reviewee" cards (below) are the
  fine-grained surface. Each card is configurable — the
  operator picks which entities to include, what shape they
  want (single CSV vs zip-of-N) — and clicks Download on that
  card to get exactly those files. The page is **the
  operator's data-shaping workbench**; each card produces a
  scoped download.
- **Top "Zip all" button.** A one-click shortcut that
  downloads every response-side CSV in a single archive
  (`{code}_responses.zip`). Members: unified `responses.csv`
  + bundle-only `reviewer_stats.csv` + `reviewee_stats.csv` +
  one `instrument_{n}.csv` per instrument sorted
  reviewee-first. This is the "I just want everything"
  affordance — operators who don't want to fiddle with
  per-lens configuration can take the full set with one
  click. Sits in the top-right of the page intro card so
  it's the first affordance the operator sees on entry.

The two shapes are complementary, not redundant. Zip-all is
the operator's "I trust the default; give me everything";
the per-lens cards are "I want it shaped a specific way."
Per-lens downloads stay independent — Zip-all doesn't
require any per-lens configuration first.

### Shipped today

- **Page layout**: 2-column grid of half-width cards, bottom-
  aligned via `align-items: end`.
  - **Left column (response data)**: `Extract all data` intro
    card (top) + `By instrument` lens (below).
  - **Right column (metadata)**: `Reviewer response metadata`
    + `Reviewee response metadata`.
  - **Full-width Data shaper** card below the grid (placeholder
    — see *Data shaper design* below).
- **Intro card** (`Extract all data`).
  - Body copy: "Configure what you need on the lens cards and
    download the specific files. Use **Zip all** to download all
    response files (as configured using the other cards) at once."
  - Chip row (all default-selected): `By instruments`,
    `Reviewer response metadata`, `Reviewee response metadata`,
    `Data shaper`. Each chip will scope which lens-shaped CSVs
    land in the top-level `Zip all` zip once wired.
  - Button: `Zip all` → `responses_bundle.zip` (unified
    Responses CSV + reviewer/reviewee stats + per-instrument
    long-format files).
- **By-instrument card**.
  - Chips: one per instrument (label = `#{n}: {short_label}`
    mirroring the Reviewer-surface heading, or bare `#{n}`
    when no short label) + cross-cutting toggles
    `Include metadata` + `All assignment rows`. All
    default-selected.
  - Button: `Zip all` → `by_instrument_bundle.zip` carrying
    one wide-format CSV per instrument, named
    `{code}_by_instrument_{slug}.csv`. Each CSV carries a
    **meta header** (instrument identity + per-field
    type/constraint rows + assignment count + pool /
    unit-of-review / self-review configuration; the latter
    three render rule fields as
    `<source_type>.<friendly label>`) + blank row + **wide
    data table** (one row per assignment, columns = identity
    + tags + one column per response field + SelfReview +
    SavedAt + SubmittedAt). Group-scoped instruments collapse
    the same way the unified Responses CSV does.
- **Reviewer / Reviewee response metadata cards**.
  - Heading + body copy explaining the data/metadata split:
    per-reviewer / per-reviewee response *data* is trivially
    reshaped from the By-instrument export via a spreadsheet
    sort or Power Query; these cards focus on *metadata
    about responses* (counts, aggregates per response field,
    against which instruments).
  - Chips (all default-selected): one chip per instrument
    (mirroring the By-instrument card's `#{n}: {short_label}`
    label, or bare `#{n}` when no short label) followed inline
    by `All reviewers` / `All reviewees`. The per-statistic
    chips (`Count`, `Mean`, `Median`, `Min`, `Max`, `Length`)
    retired — they moved into the per-(instrument, field)
    column blocks of the extract output where they apply
    by data type (see below).
  - Button: `Download` → `{code}_reviewer_metadata.csv` /
    `{code}_reviewee_metadata.csv` (a single CSV per card,
    so the button label drops the `Zip all` framing used on
    the other cards — nothing actually gets zipped here).
  - **Column shape** (Reviewer side; Reviewee side is
    symmetric, swapping `ReviewerName` / `ReviewerEmail` for
    `RevieweeName` / `RevieweeEmail`):
    - Always: `ReviewerName`, `ReviewerEmail`,
      `Assigned` (the count of reviewee × field cells the
      reviewer is supposed to fill in, scoped to the
      in-scope instruments), `Count` (those cells with a
      non-empty response).
    - Per selected instrument, per response field: one block
      named `#{N}: {short_label}.{field}.<metric>`. `{N}` is
      the instrument's 1-based **session** position (stable
      as chips toggle). Block columns always carry `.Assigned`
      + `.Count`; numeric fields (Integer / Decimal) add
      `.Mean`, `.Median`, `.Min`, `.Max`; string fields add
      `.Length` (sum of characters across non-empty
      responses).
  - **Row scoping**:
    - No instruments selected → only the two cross-instrument
      totals ship, scanning **every** session instrument so
      the totals stay meaningful.
    - `All reviewers` / `All reviewees` ON → every roster
      entry gets a row. OFF → only entries with at least
      one non-empty response in scope.
  - **Group-scoped instruments** fan responses across each
    member assignment at save time. The two sides handle that
    asymmetry differently:
    - **Reviewer side** — a reviewer fills one form per group,
      not one per member; the save layer copies the answer onto
      every member-assignment. So `Assigned` dedupes by
      `(reviewer, instrument, group_key)` (one count per group)
      and `Count` / per-field rollups dedupe by
      `(reviewer, group_key, field_id)` (one count per group
      answer, no matter how many members received the
      fan-out).
    - **Reviewee side** — from a reviewee's perspective there
      is exactly one cell per (reviewer, field) about them,
      so no dedupe is needed; each member-assignment counts on
      its own.
  - Query-string wiring on the button reuses the same
    `?instrument=<id>` (repeated) + `?all=0` shape the chip
    JS composes.
- **Data shaper** (full-width, below the grid). Placeholder
  UI shipped; persistence and file generation deferred.
  - Heading + body copy describing the generalised builder.
  - **Axis chip row** at the top of the outer card — two
    **mutually exclusive** axis-selector chips (`Reviewer`,
    `Reviewee`) + a vertical pipe + **per-instrument scope
    chips** (always visible, one per session instrument,
    labelled `#{N}: {short_label}` like the By-instrument
    card) + a slot for the relevant column chips. Clicking
    one axis deselects the other; the full `reviewer ×
    reviewee` matrix is already downloadable via the
    By-instrument card, and a row keyed by both leaves little
    to aggregate. Instrument scope chips are session-level
    filters — they apply to whichever axis is on. With no
    instrument scope chip selected the aggregates span every
    session instrument — matching the legacy "By reviewer" /
    "By reviewee" general-data framings; selecting one or
    more scopes the aggregates to those instruments. Each
    axis pool, when mounted, has two sub-groups separated by
    `|`:
    1. **Identification chips** — Name / Email / Tag 1-3
       (per-axis-entity).
    2. **Aggregate data chips** — `Count` / `Mean` / `Median`
       / `Min` / `Max` / `Length` (mirrors the Reviewer /
       Reviewee response metadata cards' aggregate column
       vocabulary).
  - **Data shape sub-card stack** below the axis row — one
    sub-card per shape. One always-present blank shape card
    on initial load (matches the band-3 response-field
    builder's always-present-empty-row pattern, so the
    operator has an immediate edit target). Each sub-card
    carries:
    - **Preview row** — `width: auto` `<thead>` whose cells
      mirror the currently-selected column chips. Toggling a
      column chip on / off adds / removes a `<th>` in the
      currently-active shape card.
    - **Action row** — name input (collapses to plain text
      on save) + `✓` save / `✎` edit / `✗` delete / `➕` add
      icons. `✓` and `✎` swap; `✗` removes the card from the
      stack except when it's the last one (never strip the
      page of its starting point); `➕` clones a fresh blank
      card after this one and makes it the active target.
  - Button: placeholder `Zip all` (`href="#"`,
    `aria-disabled`) at the bottom of the outer card.
  - **Out of scope in this slice** (lands separately):
    column-chip drag-reorder + sort-icon click on the preview
    row; per-session persistence of saved shapes; the
    file-generation pipeline; audit events.

### Data shaper design

The Data shaper is a generalised engine for composing custom
data shapes. The shipped placeholder card holds the heading
+ a preview-table stub; the full design below lands across
the next slices.

**Mental model.** Each *shape* = one CSV. The columns of the
CSV are composed by selecting **column chips** that name each
column. A shape is rendered as one **Data shape card** (a
full-width card *inside* the outer Data shaper card). One
Data shape card per shape. Multiple shapes per Data shaper
(operator clicks the `+` icon to add another below).

**Axis chip row (top of the Data shaper card).** Three
**axis-selector chips** — `Reviewer`, `Reviewee`,
`Instrument` — followed by a vertical pipe (`|`). All axis
chips default to **unselected**. Selecting an axis surfaces
its **relevant column chips** to the right of the `|` (the
list of relevant chips per axis remains to be determined —
this is the open design question for the next slice). The
operator picks column chips to compose the shape; toggling
the axis off hides its chips and removes the corresponding
columns from the active shape.

Multiple axes can be on at once — the relevant chip row
concatenates the selected axes' chips left-to-right.

**Data shape card (full-width, inside the Data shaper card).**
One per shape. Layout, top to bottom:

1. **Preview row** — the selected column chips render as the
   header row of the CSV being built. Flush-left, `width:
   auto`; each column sized to its header. (The placeholder
   table shipped today is the stub for this row.) Sort-icon
   per column (visual today; click + drag-reorder wiring
   follows).
2. **Edit box** for the shape's name + **tick icon** (save the
   sequence under the typed name) + **X icon** (delete this
   shape) + **+ icon** (add a new blank Data shape card below
   this one).

On save: the edit box collapses to the saved name as plain
text, and the tick icon flips to an **edit icon** (clicking
it restores the edit box so the operator can rename).

**Operator's mental loop.** Toggle axes → pick column chips
→ see the preview-row header update live → name and save the
shape → click `+` to start a new one. The end state is a
stack of named Data shape cards, each describing one CSV
that ships in the Data shaper's `Zip all` zip — and, when
the intro card's `Data shaper` chip is selected, in the
top-level `Zip all` too.

**Open design questions for the next slice.** All five
resolved 2026-05-29 — see *Data shaper — open design
questions* below for the full answers; the placeholder
prompts that lived here have been removed.

### Data shaper — open design questions (resolved 2026-05-29)

1. **Relevant column chips per axis.**
   - **Reviewer**: `Name`, `Email`, `Tag 1`, `Tag 2`, `Tag 3`
     (rendered with their session-friendly labels where set)
     + the per-reviewer aggregate chips (`Count`, `Mean`,
     `Median`, `Min`, `Max`, `Length` — same vocabulary as the
     Reviewer response metadata card).
   - **Reviewee**: same shape as Reviewer (`Name`, `Email`,
     three tags + the six aggregate chips). For group-scoped
     instruments the row identity is the **composed group
     name** from `_compose_group_identity` — one row per group
     identity is enough; no per-member fan-out at this layer.
   - **Instrument**: `Short label`, response-field labels (one
     chip per response field defined on the instrument), and
     per-field aggregate chips (same six).
   - More axis-relevant chips may surface later — the slice
     ships with the above as the v1 set.

2. **Per-axis vs cross-axis aggregates — confirmed.** The
   *axes* drive grouping (one row per unique combination of
   selected axes' identity chips); the aggregate chips drive
   the value columns. Example: with `Reviewer` selected as
   the only axis, each row = one reviewer; columns = on a
   per-instrument basis, aggregate data (e.g. mean / min /
   max response value on a numeric response field, mean /
   min / max response length for a string field, etc.).

3. **Persistence — per-session only.** Saved shapes live on
   the session, not on the operator. Every operator with
   access to the session sees the same shape library. No
   cross-session copy in v1.

4. **`Zip all` membership — N CSVs, one per shape.** The Data
   shaper card's `Zip all` produces one CSV per saved shape,
   named after the shape. The top-level intro-card `Zip all`
   folds those same CSVs in when the intro card's
   `Data shaper` chip is selected.

5. **Empty-state behaviour — block the save.** A Data shape
   card with no column chips selected is not savable. The
   tick icon stays disabled (or surfaces an inline error)
   until at least one column chip is on.

### The three lenses on the new page (legacy framing)

The original plan called these "By instrument / By reviewer /
By reviewee". As shipped, the by-reviewer / by-reviewee
lenses retired and the cards became **Reviewer response
metadata** / **Reviewee response metadata** (metadata, not
data — see the rationale above). The by-instrument lens
stayed and is fully wired today. The table below remains for
historical context.

| Lens | Shape | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| **By instrument** | One CSV per instrument; rows = (reviewee × reviewer) pairs for that instrument; columns = response fields side-by-side. Plus a "All instruments unified" download that matches today's `responses.csv`. | "How did everyone score on this rubric?" Cross-reviewer comparison on one instrument. |
| **By reviewer** | One CSV per reviewer; rows = every response that reviewer made; columns include instrument / reviewee / field / value. Plus a per-reviewer summary roll-up (one row per reviewer, completion + counts). | "What did this reviewer produce?" Individual reviewer audit / coaching. |
| **By reviewee** | One CSV per reviewee; rows = every response made *about* that reviewee; columns include reviewer / instrument / field / value. Plus a per-reviewee summary roll-up (one row per reviewee, aggregated counts / averages where numeric). | "What did everyone say about this reviewee?" Feedback packet for the reviewed person. |

Each lens offers:

- A **single combined download** (one CSV across all instruments / reviewers / reviewees in that lens) for analyst-tool ingestion.
- A **per-entity zip** (one CSV per instrument / reviewer / reviewee) for human-readable handoff.

Self-review / group-scoped semantics carry over from the
existing `responses.csv`:

- `SelfReview` flag stays available in every lens.
- Group-scoped instruments collapse to one row per
  (reviewer × group × field), same as today's
  `serialize_responses_for_instrument`.

### What the new page does NOT do

- **No charts, no aggregates beyond simple roll-ups.** Means
  (averages, counts, completion %) only when they're cheap
  CSV columns. No histograms, no rendered tables-as-images.
- **No row-level filtering UI.** Operators get whole-session
  cuts along three axes; finer slicing happens offline. (If
  operator demand surfaces later, a future iteration can add
  filters; the stub deliberately leaves them out to keep the
  first version small.)
- **No exports of audit / lifecycle metadata.** Audit log
  download already lives at Sys Admin per industry best
  practice (`docs/status.md` Segment 16A notes); the new
  page stays response-data only.

## Open design questions (resolved 2026-05-29)

1. **Per-reviewer / per-reviewee single CSV vs zip of CSVs —
   one big CSV.** The single-CSV shape ships; the
   zip-of-N-per-reviewer or per-reviewee handoff use case
   belongs to the eventual Participant model (each
   participant fetches their own data through the
   participant surface), not to a bulk-CSV download here.

2. **Numeric roll-ups.** Resolved on the metadata cards
   directly — `Count`, `Mean`, `Median`, `Min`, `Max`,
   `Length` all ship as toggleable chips. The Data shaper
   inherits the same vocabulary for its aggregate column
   chips.

3. **Group-scoped reviewee semantics — one row per group
   identity.** The composed name from
   `_compose_group_identity` is sufficient; no
   "by group member" fan-out at this layer.

4. **The Zip-all on Session Home post-split — settings
   only.** The Session Home Extract-setup card's `Zip all`
   bundles just `settings.csv` (the Reviewers / Reviewees /
   Relationships rows ship as individual downloads, not in
   the home bundle). Response-data zips live on the new
   Extract data page.

5. **Settings.csv stays on Session Home — yes.** It's the
   round-trippable surface Quick Setup ingests, so it
   belongs in the home Extract setup card.

## Blast radius (rough estimate, pre-execution)

- **New page surface** — `app/web/routes_operator/_extract_data.py`
  (new), `app/web/templates/operator/session_extract_data.html`
  (new), `app/web/views/_extract_data_page.py` (new — view-shape
  adapter). Three new files, maybe ~500-800 LOC total.
- **Existing card rename** — `app/web/views/_extract_data.py`
  (rename internal vars / strings to "Extract setup"; drop the
  Responses row; rewire bundle to four CSVs),
  `app/web/templates/operator/partials/_extract_data_card.html`
  (rename, drop responses row), `app/web/templates/operator/
  session_detail.html` (include path stays if file is renamed
  in place).
- **Top nav** — `app/web/templates/operator/partials/
  session_top_nav.html` (add the new tab + extend `_ops_pages`).
- **Bundle builder** — `app/services/extracts/zip_bundle.py`
  (drop responses from the home bundle; add new bundles for
  the response-data page lenses).
- **Tests** — likely 6-10 new tests (each lens × single vs zip
  × happy path; plus a few permission / lifecycle tests).
- **Spec docs** — `spec/session_home.md` (rename card),
  potentially a new `spec/extract_data.md` (or fold into an
  existing operator-page spec) for the new page.

Estimate: **3-4 PRs**:

1. Rename the Session Home card to **Extract setup**; drop
   the Responses row from it; rewire the Zip-all bundle to
   four CSVs. (Mechanical; no new routes.)
2. Add the new **Extract data** tab + route stub; render an
   empty page with the three-lens skeleton + tile placeholders.
3. Wire the **by-instrument** lens (mostly re-uses
   `serialize_responses_for_instrument`).
4. Wire the **by-reviewer** + **by-reviewee** lenses
   (new serialisers; reuse the response query / group-scope
   collapsing machinery).

PR 1 is independent of 2-4 and can land first to clean up
the Session Home surface.

## Sequencing

- **Independent of the queued schedule.** Doesn't block or
  depend on URL remodel / 14B / 19 / 20.
- **Best after URL remodel.** If URL remodel lands first,
  any internal links from the new page to the reviewer
  surface ship with `/me/` prefixes from day 1.
- **Independent of the participant model.** The new page is
  operator-only; nothing in it presumes reviewee or observer
  identities.
- **Independent of 14B.** No email surface; no outbox
  interaction.

## Risk acceptances

- **Operators who scripted against the Zip-all bundle
  expecting Responses inside.** Beta-state → no real scripts
  → break cleanly. The new page exports the same data
  shaped better; the responses Zip-all button is the direct
  replacement.
- **Filename change: ``{code}_bundle.zip`` →
  ``{code}_setup.zip``.** Same rationale — beta-state, no
  scripts to break. The new ``{code}_responses.zip`` covers
  the response-data side.
- **URL shape collisions.** `extract-data` as a tab slug
  doesn't collide with existing routes
  (`/operator/sessions/{id}/extract-data` is unused per
  `grep`).
- **Card vs page name confusion.** "Extract setup" (card on
  Home) vs "Extract data" (Operations tab) — distinct enough
  that the operator won't conflate them. The card label
  carries the setup-portability framing; the tab label
  carries the analysis-shaping framing.

## Done when

- Session Home card label reads **Extract setup**; its row
  list is Reviewers / Reviewees / Relationships / Session
  settings / Zip-all-of-four; the Responses row is gone.
- A new **Extract data** tab appears in the Operations strip
  between Responses and the end of the strip.
- The Extract data page surfaces three lens sections
  (by instrument / by reviewer / by reviewee) with at least
  a single CSV per lens and (recommended) a zip-of-N
  per-entity bundle per lens.
- Group-scoped collapsing and the `SelfReview` flag carry
  over to the new lenses.
- Existing `/operator/sessions/{id}/export/responses.csv`
  route stays live (the by-instrument unified CSV redirects
  here or reuses the same serialiser); operators with
  pre-existing direct-URL habits don't 404.
- Full suite passes (existing extracts tests unchanged;
  new tests added for the new lenses).
- `guide/extract_data.md` → `guide/archive/` per the
  segment-closeout convention; `spec/session_home.md`
  updated for the card rename; a new spec doc (or section)
  covers the page if not already.

## Related context

- `app/web/views/_extract_data.py` — the current Session
  Home card view adapter (becomes "Extract setup").
- `app/web/routes_operator/_extracts.py` — existing CSV
  routes (`/sessions/{id}/export/{kind}.csv`); new routes
  may reuse these or sibling-mount under
  `/sessions/{id}/extract-data/...`.
- `app/services/extracts/responses_extract.py` — existing
  serialisers: `serialize_responses` (unified),
  `serialize_responses_for_instrument` (by-instrument lens
  is mostly this), `serialize_reviewer_session_summary`
  (already wired for the reviewer-side surface; by-reviewer
  operator lens reuses the same shape).
- `spec/session_home.md` — Session Home page spec; the card
  rename lands here.
- `guide/url_remodel.md` — landing this first means internal
  links in the new page ship with the future-correct URL
  prefix on day 1.
